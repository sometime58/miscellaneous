If you keep Emacs open all the time you end up accumulating lots of buffers. That can make navigating a little bit awkward.
Projectile is a really nice package that makes navigating in and between projects much easier. I also have counsel-projectile installed.
Here's my configuration:
;; projectile (use-package projectile :ensure t :config (projectile-global-mode) (setq projectile-completion-system &#39;ivy)) (use-package counsel-projectile :ensure t :config (counsel-projectile-on))  Projectile considers a sub-directory tree to be a project if it's a git or other source control repo, if it's created by tool like lein, maven, or sbt, or if you put an empty file named **.
