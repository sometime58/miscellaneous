What essential topics should we teach in our intro courses? This seems to be a recurring topic recently.

I remember thinking about this years ago when APCS moved from C++ to Java. Both languages have good and bad points both for practical and educational use. A big loss in the move to Java was memory management and the topics you could cover when memory issues arose.
