I thought I'd answer Alfred Thompson's recent post on using textbooks. Like Alfred, I've never used textbooks particularly effectively. Even when I taught math I mostly used them as a resource for problems.
I also agree with Alfred in questioning the "flipped class" model or as I like to call it "homework" for reasons similar to Alfred's.
Even back in the Pascal days of APCS getting textbooks was an ordeal in NYC.
