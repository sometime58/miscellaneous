For those of that don&rsquo;t know, the New York Tech Meetup it&rsquo;s one of the things that help make the New York Tech Scene so awesome.
It&rsquo;s a group of some 30k+ members and once a month, at Skriball Center at NYU they hold a meetup. It&rsquo;s really quite an event. Members of the tech community demo their projects, there&rsquo;s question and answer time, and afterwards theres a gathering for schmoozing amongst the crowd and the presenters.
