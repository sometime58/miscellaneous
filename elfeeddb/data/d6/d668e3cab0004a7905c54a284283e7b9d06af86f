I think my one regret over the years is that I haven&rsquo;t done much travel. So, when I had the opportunity to go to the 2014 Tapia conference, I jumped at the chance. I didn&rsquo;t get to see too much of Seattle, but that&rsquo;s OK. Now I&rsquo;ve more incentive to go back.
In addition to seeing new sites, it also gave me an opportunity to see friends that I don&rsquo;t get to see too often.
