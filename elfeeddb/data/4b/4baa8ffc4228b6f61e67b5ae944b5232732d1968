Who's this Z guy? Hi, I'm Mike Zamansky.
I'm a professsor at Hunter College working on two major projects. One is to create and run a program to certify middle and high school computer science teachers.
We're also creating a new CS undergraduate honors program and I'm the mentor. We're going to be one of the few CS programs that in addition to giving our students all the CS background and theory, will connect students to current industry practices and opportunities.
