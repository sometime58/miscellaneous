I saw a couple of tweets from Sarah Judd this morning:
A lot of CS Ed PD assumes you are new to CS. I really want CS Ed PD for people like us that came from a CS background and want to understand the pedagogy for CS in particular better. Do you know of some?

Yes! I love SIGCSE and CSTA. I just feel like.
