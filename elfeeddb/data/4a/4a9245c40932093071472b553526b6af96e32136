Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose 
 The more things change, the more they stay the same.  Last week we heard all about the new SAT. Going back to 1600 points, writing optional, and reworking the verbal section.  Immediate responses ranged from the usual fact that SAT doesn't correlate with college success to the idea that the motive was not to improve the test but rather to recapture market share from the ACT.
