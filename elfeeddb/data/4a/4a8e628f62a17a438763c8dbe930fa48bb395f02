 One of the things I love about StuyCS is that we've built a true Geek culture.  Last week, we had a last minute visitor - Stephen Wolfram. Well known for Mathematica and more importantly, Wolfram Alpha, without which our students wouldn't be able to complete all their homework.  The only problem was that we had about 24 hours from when the visit was confirmed til the talk was to take place.
