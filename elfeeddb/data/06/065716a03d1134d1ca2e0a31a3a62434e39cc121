 That's how I introduce myself whenever I attend a former student's wedding. It leads to all sorts of confusion.  Even better was the time I was at the wedding of two former students. I had just dropped around 65 pounds and was wearing my hair differently. I sat at a table filled with former students that didn't recognize me &#x2013; they had no reason to expect me, out of context and all.
