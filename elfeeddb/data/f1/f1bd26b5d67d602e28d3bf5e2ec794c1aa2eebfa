Ok, it's a word search.
We're always looking for interesting applications to build lessons around. Over the years, I've tried different things when teaching 2 dimensional arrays. Simple game boards, representing a crossword puzzle, tables of various sorts, etc.
This year,&nbsp;JonAlf, one of my amazingly talented colleagues,&nbsp;decided to go with building a word search. I decided to steal the idea. It's a great one.
I thought I'd use this post to go through the project and why I like it.
