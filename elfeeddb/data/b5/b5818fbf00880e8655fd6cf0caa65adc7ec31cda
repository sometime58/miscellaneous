The other week I was invited by Brandon Diamond and Ilana Sufrin to participate in HuffPost Labs podcast - Floating Points.  I've known Brandon for a while and he's a really awesome guy. He's a techie for sure but he also understands the importance of community building. Brandon and Ilana (also awesome but I haven't known her as long) are at HuffPost labs and also are working on important initiatives like Hacker Union.
