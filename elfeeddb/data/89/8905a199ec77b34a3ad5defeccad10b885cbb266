In part 2 I talked about how I used Hyrdas to quickly navigate through elfeed tags. It was a nice step up but the fact that I still had to manually edit my configuration code for every new tag to update the hydra was a problem.
Basically, I had to somehow or other, take a list of all the active tags and with it build a defhydra command that will then make my Hydra.
