Shortly after our event at Foursquare, I was chatting with Kevin Friedman (Stuy '96). Kevin's startup is Cojourneo&nbsp;and since it has an educational bent, he thought I might be interested in hearing about it.
I certainly was.
Rather than visiting Kevin, I thought it would be fun to have him come down after school, present Cojourneo to any students that wanted to stay late and then field questions.
Cojourneo is an interesting product.
