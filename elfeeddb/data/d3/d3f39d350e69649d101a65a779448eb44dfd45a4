The subtitle of this post is:
 and why my students are going to hate me tomorrow.
 When my good friend Gerry Seidman talks to my classes, he frequently says &ldquo;never use a data structure or algorithm you couldn&rsquo;t build yourself.&rdquo;
This doesn&rsquo;t mean that you have to write everything from scratch, just that you should have some knowledge as to what&rsquo;s going on under the hood. I find that all too often young programmers just rely on APIs and libraries and really don&rsquo;t know how their computers and programs are working.
