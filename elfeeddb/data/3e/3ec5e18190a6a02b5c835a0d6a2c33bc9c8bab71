 Spreadsheets are terrific - we've all used them. I particularly like Google spreadsheets - I use them all the time to collect data, usually from students.  Go to Google Drive  Make a form  Send the form out to the students  Wait  
 All the data gets dumped into a Google spreadsheet. The trouble is, what to do with it once it's in the spreadsheet.
