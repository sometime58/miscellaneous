Back to school last Thursday after almost two week off. Twenty four hours later - Snow Day. I know this sounds a bit hokey, but I really would have rather had school. I love a good snow day as much as the next guy, but after a big vacation, I was really ready to get back to work with the kids.
Saturday, hacking sessions were set to resume. Being in Manhattan, getting around was pretty easy but we&rsquo;ve got hackers from all over the city from Staten Island to the Bronx.
