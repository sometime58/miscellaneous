Sorting from the top and from the bottom I've been meaning to write this post for a couple of weeks, but some times life just gets in the way. I've always thought it important to arm students with as many different tools with which to attack problems as possible. As such, the courses I teach use a number of different languages, each highlighting a different paradigm and thought process. The hope is that by the end of the sequence, they can look at problems from many different angles.
