<p><em>Update 2018-10-01: As /u/ReneFroger mentioned in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/9kcbub/interview_with_thierry_volpiatto_helm_author/">Reddit thread</a>, it’s important to note that <a href="https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/issues/2083">Helm is in bug-fix-only mode at the moment</a> because of family and financial commitments.</em></p>
<p>There are quite a few amazing people in the Emacs community, some with stories you’d never guess. A bunch of people thought you might like learning about Thierry Volpiatto (the current maintainer of Helm), so they interviewed him. Since they don’t have a blog of their own, they asked me to post the interview on their behalf. Here it is!</p>
<p>-—</p>
<p><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Thierry-Volpiatto.jpg"><img alt="" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-29317 alignright" height="200" src="http://sachachua.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Thierry-Volpiatto-133x200.jpg" width="133" /></a></p>
<p>Thierry Volpiatto is one of the most prolific contributors to the Emacs community, having led the development of Helm since 2011, as well as contributing to other Emacs packages. He is the one of the Emacs Lisp package maintainers who we can’t see often enough, doing a good job and giving back to the community! But Thierry tends to work quietly in his projects, so most of us don’t know him very well. He seems to have only a GitHub profile, without anything else on the Internet. So, at my request, Thierry was kind enough to answer a few questions about himself and his work, and we’re happy to have this opportunity to learn more about him!</p>
<p>First, a little history. Before Helm was called Helm, it was a project called <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Anything">Anything.el</a> by <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TamasPatrovics">Tamas Patrovics</a>, similar to Drew Adams’s <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Icicles">Icicles</a> project. In 2008, <i>rubikitch</i> took over development, and then in 2011, Thierry took over. During this period Anything was renamed to Helm. Since then Thierry has put thousands of hours and nearly 7,000 commits into the <a href="https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm">emacs-helm repository</a>, adding innumerable features, fixing bugs, and patiently responding to (oft-repeated) questions from users, making Helm what many people consider an essential part of the Emacs experience. It’s currently the most-downloaded package on MELPA (after <code>dash.el</code>, a library used by other packages), with over 640,000 downloads since 2013.</p>
<p>Helm follows the same philosophy as Emacs: at first sight, it might be difficult to see how Helm could benefit you, but like Emacs, Helm will fully mold to your needs to find files, search in data and navigate. Nearly 200 packages on MELPA are based on Helm package.</p>

<h3 id="orgff0e123">Who is Thierry Volpiatto?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgff0e123"> </div>
<div class="outline-4" id="outline-container-org1090caf">
<h4 id="org1090caf">Tell us a little about yourself and your family, where you live, etc.</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org1090caf">I’m 55 years old, French, and I’ve been a mountain guide in the Alps since 1984. For 20 years I guided people climbing the greatest summits and walls of the Alps, as well as canyoning and via feratta each summer, while working in the winter as a ski instructor and guiding people climbing icefalls. I’m now living in the south of France with my family, guiding people only rock climbs. I started programming 12 years ago (in 2006) when I discovered how useful a computer is when you know how to use it! I learned by reading books and other people’s source code.</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-4" id="outline-container-org51ebfc8">
<h4 id="org51ebfc8">Do you speak any foreign languages?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org51ebfc8">I speak (more or less) English and Spanish.</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-4" id="outline-container-orgaf3933e">
<h4 id="orgaf3933e">Do you often program in languages other than Emacs Lisp? If so, why?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgaf3933e">Not often now, because Lisp takes all my time dedicated to computing, but I used to program in Python, and I often write shell scripts when needed.</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-4" id="outline-container-org845f499">
<h4 id="org845f499">I’ve heard your day job is completely unrelated to Emacs or IT. What do you do, and how did you come to be in that field?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org845f499">I work outdoors with rock climbing. When I’m not working, I train myself for rock climbing anyway. :-) I discovered programming after installing a Linux box and starting to write shell scripts. Then I learned Python, Lisp and finally Elisp.</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-4" id="outline-container-orgf4fcb05">
<h4 id="orgf4fcb05">That’s very interesting. We often see that Emacs developers work in IT, which lends itself to similar work like maintaining packages. Do you enjoy your work?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf4fcb05">Yes, I love rock climbing, mountaineering, and staying outdoors more generally.</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-4" id="outline-container-org604bb4e">
<h4 id="org604bb4e">Are you interested in working in IT or FOSS development?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org604bb4e">No to be frankly, because I want to keep the freedom of going outdoors as much as possible.</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-4" id="outline-container-org2e351b6">
<h4 id="org2e351b6">What does your family think about your work in the Emacs community?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org2e351b6">They think I spend too much time on Emacs, but they are also happy to see me at home during this time, not running in the mountains. :-)</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org712b5d3">
<h3 id="org712b5d3">Emacs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org712b5d3"> </div>
<div class="outline-4" id="outline-container-org3c9479a">
<h4 id="org3c9479a">Tell us a little about your computer setup: operating system, software and tools you use, etc.</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org3c9479a">I actually use Linux Mint, I am a fan of Nix systems, shell scripts etc. Most of the time I use Emacs, of course, Tmux, and Firefox.</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-4" id="outline-container-org1d0f372">
<h4 id="org1d0f372">How would you describe your Emacs configuration?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org1d0f372">I install a few, very important packages for me in the <code>site-lisp</code> directory with <code>make</code>: <code>emacs-async</code>, <code>use-package</code>, <code>psession</code> and <code>helm</code>, of course. Other packages are installed locally from a local <code>elisp</code> directory. Finally, some packages are installed from MELPA with <code>package.el</code> through the <code>helm</code> interface. I install different versions of Emacs in a separate directory (<code>/sbin</code>) and I have a shell script that allows changing versions easily.</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-4" id="outline-container-org77180eb">
<h4 id="org77180eb">What packages are very useful to you?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org77180eb">I don’t use many packages. I use <code>mu4e</code> for emails, as well as <code>w3m</code>, <code>magit</code>, <code>iedit</code>, <code>emamux</code>, <code>wgrep</code>, and <code>emms</code>. The others are packages I wrote myself like <code>psession</code>, <code>addressbook</code>, etc., and a few <code>helm</code> packages not bundled with <code>helm</code> itself like <code>helm-ls-git</code>, <code>helm-w3m</code>, <code>helm-firefox</code>, <code>helm-descbinds</code>, <code>helm-emms</code>, <code>helm-dictionary</code>, <code>helm-addressbook</code>, and <code>helm-apt</code>. <code>helm</code>, <code>async</code>, <code>psession</code> and <code>mu4e</code> are the most important, with <code>magit</code> as well.</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-4" id="outline-container-org1cf4440">
<h4 id="org1cf4440">How did you come to use Emacs?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org1cf4440">Like everybody, I think, I started using Emacs because I was looking for a text editor to edit my code, investigated Emacs and I ended up writing Elisp code.</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-4" id="outline-container-org974a849">
<h4 id="org974a849">Why do you use Emacs?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org974a849">Emacs allows me to do nearly everything, and more importantly, I can write code to do what I want.</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-4" id="outline-container-orgdb6285b">
<h4 id="orgdb6285b">What’s your favorite way of managing your to-do lists, projects, issues, etc?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgdb6285b">I’m not very organized like some other people who have to-dos in <code>org-mode</code> with priorities, time spent, etc. I’m not a super <code>org-mode</code> user even if I do use it for storing information, notes, etc. I frequently use <code>calendar</code> and <code>diary</code> in Emacs for RDV, etc.</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-4" id="outline-container-orgb62ee8e">
<h4 id="orgb62ee8e">If you could make any changes in the Emacs “ecosystem” or community, what would they be?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb62ee8e">I think the future of Emacs lies in projects like Remacs, open to the world with no political constraint, with people writing nice modules like <code>magit</code>, installable from modern platforms like MELPA. The model of Emacs and ELPA development is somewhat deprecated and inefficient, in my opinion.</div>
</div>

<div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-orgd76e24d">
<h3 id="orgd76e24d">Helm’s history and status</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd76e24d"> </div>
<div class="outline-4" id="outline-container-org5bb7d04">
<h4 id="org5bb7d04">Why did you become Anything.el’s maintainer in 2011?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5bb7d04">I started developing <code>anything</code> much earlier, I think, in 2008. I never liked all the <code>*completions*</code> buffers, <code>dired</code> buffers, etc. in Emacs, and when I discovered <code>anything,</code> I thought that it was the way to make Emacs more usable. Even now I think Emacs might be difficult to use efficiently without the help of a package like <code>helm</code>.</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-4" id="outline-container-org36e8781">
<h4 id="org36e8781">Looking back on these past 7 years, did you imagine Helm turning out the way it has?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org36e8781">Honestly, no. If I knew this, maybe I would never have started the project. Because I have often been burned out with <code>helm</code> development. But I’m quite happy with what we have, even if a lot of work still remains to be done.</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-4" id="outline-container-org8530af0">
<h4 id="org8530af0">Is there anything that you know now that you wish you had known when you started working on Helm? What significant lessons have you learned while working on Helm?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8530af0">Yes: to do only what I can do in a reasonable amount of time. At the beginning I was trying to do everything: writing code, documentation, helping users about bugs or <code>helm</code> usage, etc., and it was too much. I’ve learned to stop or slow down before burning out.</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-4" id="outline-container-org120ad7d">
<h4 id="org120ad7d">In many ways, Helm seems designed to blend in to Emacs and complement it, rather than being like an application inside of Emacs. One of the things I’ve noticed is that, even though it’s a complex system, Helm is still very fast, which is quite a achievement. How did you make Helm so flexible and powerful without making Emacs “heavier” or slower?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org120ad7d">To be fast I had to rewrite most of the core functions. There are still improvements to do in this sector, though. In some places I had to find the balance between being clever, but not too much, to keep it fast enough, like with fuzzy matching. Also, I had to refrain from adding too many fancy things into <code>helm</code> until I found a way to make them fast enough (e.g. I added colors in <code>helm-find-files</code> for remote files only recently).</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-4" id="outline-container-orgcae0d6e">
<h4 id="orgcae0d6e">Not many packages are nearly as powerful as Helm. Being so, it may be hard for potential users to understand its value and potential. How could newcomers be encouraged to contribute to Helm’s development?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgcae0d6e">
<p>People are often thinking that <code>helm</code> is a vertical version of <code>ido</code>, but it’s not: it’s much more powerful. It would be too long to enumerate all that it does, but here’s a small example among the many features <code>helm</code> provides:</p>
<p>In <code>ido</code> or similar tools, when you complete files, the only thing you can do is press <code>RET</code> to jump to a file. With <code>helm</code> there are actually 44 actions possible, not including the ones that are automatically added depending on the context (i.e. filtered actions). All of these actions are applicable to one or many marked files, whereas in <code>ido</code> you can act on only one file. If you need a specific action that’s not part of <code>helm</code> by default, you can add it into the <code>helm</code> framework, which is same philosophy as Emacs.</p>
</div>

<div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org9576e94">
<h3 id="org9576e94">Supporting Helm’s development</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9576e94">When Jonas Bernoulli, the Magit maintainer, announced that he needed financial support last year, a large fundraising campaign was set up, which was a great success. Nearly 2,000 backers pledged $73,000 to enable him to work full-time on Magit for a whole year. On top of that, more than one hundred people pledged to donate $3,756 to him every year.</div>
<div class="outline-4" id="outline-container-org335c6aa">
<h4 id="org335c6aa">You’ve mentioned privately that maintaining Helm has become a real problem due to family and work commitments, which might be difficult to combine with your daily work in the mountains. If you were to receive enough financial support to work on Helm and other Emacs packages, what would you like to work on?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org335c6aa">
<p>Many things, for now:</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Improving <code>helm</code> requirements and auto loading.</li>
<li>Improving debugging.</li>
<li>Improving fuzzy matching.</li>
<li>Improving <code>helm-dabbrev</code>.</li>
<li>Improving elisp package management from within <code>helm</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And much more, particularly fixing incompatible Emacs changes that will inevitably happen.</p>
