Angel 1: What are the Zamansky's doing next to that bridge?
Angel 2: Maybe they're pondering if their lives have had any meaning in this world.

Angel 1: Do you think we should send Clarence to straighten them out? He seemed to do a good job

Angel 2: I don't know, maybe they're just trying to decide on where to go to dinner.
