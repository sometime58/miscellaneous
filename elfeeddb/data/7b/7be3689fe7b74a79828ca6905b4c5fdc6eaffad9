I wasn't going to go to this session. I started out in a panel on integrating social good into CS Ed. With the panel not meeting my expectations I moved over to my second choice - the system programming sessions where I saw Implementing Malloc: Students and Systems Programming, a paper presented by Brian Railing of CMU.
I really liked both the paper and the talk.
CMU computer science students all take a systems course that uses Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective.
