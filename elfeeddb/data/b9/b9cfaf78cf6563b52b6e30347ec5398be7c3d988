 The NY Times just posted an article - the mayor announced a 10 year deadline by which time all NYC public school students will be taking CS.  I should be happy.  I'm not.  I feel thoroughly defeated.  As many of you know, I've struggled for years to try to bring CS education to more kids and to train more teachers. You also probably know that over the years, I've become pretty good at this.
