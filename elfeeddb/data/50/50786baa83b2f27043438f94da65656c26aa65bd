In spite of the Java based annoyances I mentioned last time, I decided to go ahead and do Radix sort with my AP students. I usually don&rsquo;t cover it in AP Computer Science, but I like getting the kids to think about using arrays as buckets as it&rsquo;s a new way of thinking for them and it does give a non-trivial application that combines ararys and ArrayLists.
It&rsquo;s a nice little algorithm.
