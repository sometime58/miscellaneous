I generally use three email accounts. My personal one, work one, and one for my non-profit. For a couple of years, I've been using mu4e under Emacs for both my work and non-profit email accounts and gmail for my personal account.
 I've had lots of requests for a video on what I do but I've been hesitant for two reasons: There are parts of my configuration that are copied from others and I really don't understand.
