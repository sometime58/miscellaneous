 It's been a while since my last post.  That's mostly since I've getting things ready for this announcement.  I've talked about our non-profit CSTUY before. Well, we've been hard at work getting things together for our first summer program: SHIP - Summer Hackers Immersion Program  We're really excited about this - taking our years of experience teaching kids at our schools and taking it to a wider audience.
