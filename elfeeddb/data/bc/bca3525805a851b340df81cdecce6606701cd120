This morning, Mark Guzdial wrote about Stanford possibly moving away from Java as their intro language. This comes on the heels of a semi-regular thread on one of the lists I'm on asking about what languages are used at assorted colleges around the country. Invariably the Pascal - C++ - Java progression of APCS turns up in these threads.
There are plenty of arguments to be made both for and against pretty much any language or platform.
