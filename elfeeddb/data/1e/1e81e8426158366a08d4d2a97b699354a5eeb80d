 When starting the spring semester, students are frequently a little rusty. They just had a high intensity month of study, tests, and projects. That was followed by a week of nothing.  I like to start with something lightweight that gets them coding again and ramps them up to speed.  In SoftDev I started with a brief overview of the HTML5 canvas and then gave them a small homework assignment to do something fun.
