The difficulties I've had with the city and DOE are pretty well documented by now.
Today I'm going to tell you about my latest dealings with DOE and how they prevented my team from bringing free quality CS education to city students.
CSTUY's not running SHIP, its summer program this year.
That's not something I'm happy about but part of me knew it might happen. What did surprise me, although it shouldn't have, was the role that the NYC DOE played in preventing it from happening.
