Earlier in the term, our intro classes spent a little time learning some basic HTML. We don&rsquo;t spend a lot of time on it, just enough so that the students can present their work in a static web site. The end goal, though, was to programatically generate the web sites - there&rsquo;s nothing quite as empowering to a student as when they can present their work to the world.
Finally, it&rsquo;s all coming together.
