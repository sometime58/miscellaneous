 Scale, scale, scale. Scripted lessons. Online resources, Moocs. No excuses schools. All of these are modern trends in education. None of these are about good education. It's really demoralizing reading article after article devaluing true master teachers and real education.  So, last night was a real pleasure.  I attended a talk, given by Alan Alda on communicating science. The talk was sponsored by The Academy for Teachers.
