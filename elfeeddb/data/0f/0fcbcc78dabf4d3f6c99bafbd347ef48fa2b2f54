Sorry for the incosistancy of the posts. I hope to get to that one video a week soon but I've still got a hectic couple of weeks ahead.
No new material this week, or at least very little. This week, I talk about some thoughts on the "Using Emacs" series.
In the video I talk about Sacha Chua and her work as a leader in the Emacs community. Check out her stuff here: http://sachachua.
