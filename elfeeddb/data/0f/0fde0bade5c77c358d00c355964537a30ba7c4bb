I've been planning to put together a response to Alfred Thompson's recent post - Software Developers - Quantity vs Quality.
TL;DR, although it isn't really long and I do encourage you to read Alfred's post: a couple of articles talk about how the U.S. has the most people entering CS competitions like HackerRank but Americans are not at the top of the leaderboard. does this mean that there's less talent in America?
