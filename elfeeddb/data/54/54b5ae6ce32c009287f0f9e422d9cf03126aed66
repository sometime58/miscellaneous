"...&nbsp;the standardized courses don't shed much light on future opportunities and they make it hard for students to identify what they're most interested in. The CS department, on the other hand, is great at demonstrating all the things that are going on in the modern comp sci world."&nbsp;-- Asa, one of our current CS students.Asa's comment was in response to an event we held last Tuesday. We brought 100 current students up to FourSquare&nbsp;along with 100 of our CS alums for a mixer.
