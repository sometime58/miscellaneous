Now that we have a nice basic configuration, let's make Emacs look a little nicer.
Like most editors, Emacs can be extensively themed.
As shown in the video, you can quickly see the built in themes using the customize-themes command.
You can load one of these themes by using the load-theme command interactively or, more likely by putting:
(load-theme &#39;leuven t)  in your init.el. The above code loads the built in leuven theme.
