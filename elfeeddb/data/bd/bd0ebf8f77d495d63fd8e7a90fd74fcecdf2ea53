We&rsquo;re practically at the close of 2013 and it&rsquo;s high time I wished everyone wonderful things for the year to come.
It&rsquo;s also time for a new look to this blog.
Why the rewrite? Partly because I was tired of the look, but mostly because, when I put it together, it was the first time I used that toolset and was just figuring things out.
I&rsquo;m still no expert, but I thought it was time to clean things up.
