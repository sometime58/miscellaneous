Saturday was the second day of CSTUY&rsquo;s Hacking Sessions. We started out wit a minor panic - none of the laptops could connect to the wireless!!! After a brief scramble, we finally gave up and gave our host a call (sorry Davin) and the problem was swiftly addressed. From there it was off to the races.
Last week we spent most of the session with mixers and setting up the laptops.
