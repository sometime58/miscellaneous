The other day, a friend posited a question on Facebook (paraphrased):
  If called upon, would you take a job in an administration who's policies you strongly  disagreed with?  Would you go work for an administration that you reviled in order to get a seat at the table? To try to affect change from the inside or would you consider yourself a sellout or worse, publicly promote positions you disagree with.
