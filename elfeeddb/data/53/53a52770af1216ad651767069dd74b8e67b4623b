I made chapati the other day. Based on a couple of recipe requests and the fact that this blog has been dormant for a while, I thought I'd post the recipe here.
&nbsp;To start -- Chapati is an Indian flatbread. I guess what I made is technically Pulka but it's really easy to make and quite tasty.
Ingredients:
2 cups whole wheat flour1 cup water1 tsp saltMix all the ingredients together to form a dough.
