We&rsquo;re ramping up for recursion in my junior classes - state space search, nlg(n) sorts, etc. As a refresher, we took a quick look at the Fibonacci numbers.
Now, some people seem to think that it&rsquo;s a tired problem. It&rsquo;s mathy, it&rsquo;s played out, it&rsquo;s boring etc.. They just might be missing the point.
The beauty isn&rsquo;t in the problem itself, but rather, that it&rsquo;s a platform on which you can look at many problem solving techniques.
