I didn't know Hunter College had computer science.  I heard that refrain more than once during my fall visits to high schools. Part of the reason for this is due to Hunter CS's low profile and small size in spite of its high quality.
Part, though, was also because of some misconceptions about Computer Science programs. I'd hear things like "but they only offer a BA not a BS,"
