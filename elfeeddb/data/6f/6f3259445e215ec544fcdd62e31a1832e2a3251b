One thing I've learned from teaching is that there's always something new to learn. For the kids, yes, but I'm talking about for the teacher.
The other day, I taught a lesson I've taught many times. Find the mode of a data set. That's the problem that they solve but the lesson is really about run time complexity, hidden complexity and using data structures in alternate ways.
I blogged about this before so you can get an earlier take there although the code isn't formatted correctly due to blog conversions.
