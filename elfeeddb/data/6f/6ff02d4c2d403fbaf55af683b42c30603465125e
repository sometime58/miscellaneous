This week, we're going to look at my setup for Python programming.
I'm an educator, not a professional developer so I'm not working in huge code bases with dozens or more files at a time. I do periodically work in medium size code bases and will talk about cross file navigation and project management later on. There are also more powerful emacs Python packages. One being elpy. Elpy looks pretty cool but for me, it's overkill.
