I make regular use of Google's office suite. I use Google forms all the time to collect data, Google docs when I have to leave Emacs for document preparation - usually when I have to collaborate with others online and I use Google Sheets as my greadebook.
I don't do a lot of data processing using Google sheets. For that I download the data and write small scripts. On the other hand it turns out that you can do some pretty nifty things by scripting right in Google sheets.
