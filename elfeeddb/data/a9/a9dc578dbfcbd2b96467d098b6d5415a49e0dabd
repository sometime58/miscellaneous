 Last night, I attended the Dream It, Code It, Win It awards.  I'd actually write up the event but Fred Wilson's already done a better job at that than I could: http://avc.com/2014/05/dream-it-and-code-it/  As Fred stated on his blog, it's a real shame that the high schooler's didn't get to show off their work but it was great to see that there were entries from a variety of schools including The Academy for Software Engineering and The Young Women's Leadership Academy.
