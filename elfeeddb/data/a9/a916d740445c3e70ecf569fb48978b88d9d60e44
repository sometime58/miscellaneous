So, the Citibike program has been running for a bit. I like the idea, but I have some reservations &ndash; it&rsquo;s great for getting around in the zone - I&rsquo;ve been using it for short shopping trips - run cross town to Fairway or take a quick trip from work to Porto Rico Importers or Rocco&rsquo;s Pastries. On the other hand, the zone doesn&rsquo;t get to the residential neighborhoods of upper Manhattan or the boroughs and the price per day is way too expensive for regular working class joes, particularly on top of a subway trip.
