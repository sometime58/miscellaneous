 Has everyone seen Advent of Code?  It's a site with a series of programming problems that are being revealed one a day, a la an advent calendar. You can read more about it here.  I came to the party a little late so I'm only up to day 6.  Each problem comes in two parts. The second is revealed after you complete the first.
