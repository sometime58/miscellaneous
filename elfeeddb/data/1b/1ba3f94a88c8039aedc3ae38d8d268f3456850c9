AP scores just came out. As usual, I see the posts and take part in conversations where teachers talk about their results. Some are happy about their results, some aren't, some don't really care.
I just want to make a plea to all AP teachers out there:
Don't let your value be dictated by the college board or any other exam.
I never really cared much about my students' actual AP scores.
