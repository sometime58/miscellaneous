One week ago today was Stuyvesant's graduation.  I usually know a number of seniors pretty well but, since I like to cycle through classes, every couple of years I have a group that I've been with from 10th grade to 12th.  This was one of those years  It was extra special because it was also my daughter Batya's graduating class.  It's been an amazing gift to be able to work at her school for the past four years and she's been amazingly tolerant.
