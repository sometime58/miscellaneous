We just finished week 4 of CSTUY&rsquo;s Hacking Sessions.
I&rsquo;m really happy with how our hackers are doing - they&rsquo;re a great bunch and even if they don&rsquo;t realize it yet, are making great progress.
Meanwhile, as an instructor and program designer I&rsquo;m noticing the differences between a once a week program and having a class every day (note - I&rsquo;m not the sole designer or instructor. I have a great team - JonAlf, Sam, and Topher are three of the best teachers I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of working with - this post, however, is based on my observations).
