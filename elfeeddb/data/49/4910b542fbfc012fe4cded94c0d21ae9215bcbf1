 I was brought up on Gilberg and Sullvan. My father, who always wanted to be an opera singer sang with LOOM back in the day and there was always classical music playing. Either from the Hi Fi or my father singing.  Recently, there's been a kerfufle over what was to be NYGASP's production of Mikado.  My son, Natan wrote a terrific blog post on it and the suspension of belief in opera.
