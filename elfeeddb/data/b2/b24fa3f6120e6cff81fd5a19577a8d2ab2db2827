Thursday night I compiled a new Emacs from the Emacs-26 branch<sup><a class="footref" href="http://irreal.org/blog/?tag=emacs&amp;feed=rss2#fn.1" id="fnr.1">1</a></sup>. Today, Friday, I updated my OS to Mojave. I’m happy to say that everything seems to be working fine. I will hold off publishing this until Saturday just to make sure nothing nasty pops up.

It does appear, though, that Alan Third’s patches have resolved all the problems that people were reporting. Thanks to Alan and all the others who worked on getting this resolved so quickly.

Compiling Emacs from source now requires a later version of <code>makeinfo</code> than I had on my system. The easiest way to resolve that is to use <code>brew</code> to get the latest texinfo release. Of course, you can just get the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/">source from GNU</a> and compile it yourself if you’d rather.
