Today was my 50th Birthday. I'm usually pretty low key on birthdays and today was no different. I got up, exercised, went to work, taught my class and went back to my office for office hours.
What a great surprise when all of a sudden my students from last year appeared at my office with a Happy Birthday a card and a cake: It felt pretty terrific. I wasn't expecting this and was really moved.
