I think it's time for me to start developing a CS Ethics class.
An ethics course isn't a replacement for having teachers that live and model good behavior and weave ethical issues throughout the curriculum but still, adding a separate course on top of that has its merits.
I'm not in a rush to create this course. I might be done in a month or it might take a couple of years.
