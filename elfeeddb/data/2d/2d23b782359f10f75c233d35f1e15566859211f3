I'm spending the weekend up in Michigan. Visiting my brother and is family. We're here to see the UMGASS production of Gilbert and Sullivan's The Sorcerer. Batya also came up from Cornell to join us so the two families are all togehter for the first time in about 10 years.
This hasn't left much time for Advent of Code but I did manage to finish yesterday's challenge this morning.
What took me so long?
