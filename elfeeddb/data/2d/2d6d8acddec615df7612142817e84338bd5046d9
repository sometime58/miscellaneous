If you know me you know that my morning reads include a visit over to avc.com, Today, Fred's post talked about development and progress, evolution, if you would, in the city. Although not directly related, it got me thinking about gentrification.
To me, gentrification all too often seems to result in pushing out people and business that were there during the hard times.
We don't need to force out long time residents that can no longer make rent - we need to uplift communities with pathways to towards greater economic opportunity.
