Classes started up again today so I thought I'd talk about my class rules.
I don't seem to recall many class rules in college. Sure, there was a grading policy governing homework and the like but not much beyond that. In K12 there are usually more. When you can talk, how you set up your notebook, how to do homework, bathroom policy etc.
For years, I've used the same set of class rules and I always talk about the rules with my classes.
