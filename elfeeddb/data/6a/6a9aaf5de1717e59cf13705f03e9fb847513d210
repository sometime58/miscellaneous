I usually don't do year in review posts. At Stuy, not much changed year after year so I never felt it worth summarizing the past and projecting the future. At Hunter, now that I'm a couple of years in, projects are really picking up steam so I think it's worth talking about them.
One of my two major missions at Hunter was to build a CS Honors program and raise the profile of Hunter's undergraduate CS program in general.
