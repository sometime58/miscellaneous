This question appeared on Facebook a few days ago:
  Does anyone have an effective way to teach students how to break down  a problem into steps and then solve each step one by one? I think my  students are struggling with a large question and breaking it in  subsequent parts.  There were some good suggestions. I wanted to add something but didn't have time then so I thought I'd write it up now.
