Over on Facebook, my Alma Mater and long time employer, Stuyvesant High School seems to be making a big push to up it's Regeneron Science Talent Search game. For those of you who aren't familiar, that's the latest incarnation of the Westinghouse Science Talent Search from back in my day.
It seems that Stuyvesant hasn't had that many semi finalists, finalists, and winners over the past few years and isn't happy about it.
