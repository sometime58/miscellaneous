 It's been a while since my last post and a while since I started at Hunter.  Time to share a bit about what I've been up to.  One of the better kept secrets in New York City is Hunter College's computer science program. It's been around for years and it's been that way for years. In fact, when I was looking to get my masters degree back in the mid nineties I carefully researched all of the area's MS in CS programs.
