Tomorrow morning I fly out to Seattle for SIGCSE 2017. For those of you not in the CS Education space, SIGCSE is the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) special interest group for computer science education.
I've wanted to go for years but have never been able. It's hard for a high school teacher to miss a week in mid March, particularly in places with a school calendar similar to New York.
