 It's hard to believe that this is my 25th year teaching and that my first StuyCS class graduated in June 1995. It's really hard to believe that I'm now looking at the end of a significant part of my life and career.  Over the summer, Mariya, Kachun, and Stella, all writers for Stuy's Spectator worte an article that chronicled StuyCS. It's a really nice piece.
