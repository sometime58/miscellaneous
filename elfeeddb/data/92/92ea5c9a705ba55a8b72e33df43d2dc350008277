<p>Both Firefox and Chrome have a feature for creating temporary private
browsing sessions. Firefox calls it <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/private-browsing-use-firefox-without-history">Private Browsing</a> and Chrome
calls it <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464">Incognito Mode</a>. Both work essentially the same way. A
temporary browsing session is started without carrying over most
existing session state (cookies, etc.), and no state (cookies,
browsing history, cached data, etc.) is preserved after ending the
session. Depending on the configuration, some browser extensions will
be enabled in the private session, and their own internal state may be
preserved.</p>

<p>The most obvious use is for visiting websites that you don’t want
listed in your browsing history. Another use for more savvy users is
to visit websites with a fresh, empty cookie file. For example, some
news websites use a cookie to track the number visits and require a
subscription after a certain number of “free” articles. Manually
deleting cookies is a pain (especially without a specialized
extension), but opening the same article in a private session is two
clicks away.</p>

<p>For web development there’s yet another use. A private session is a way
to view your website from the perspective of a first-time visitor.
You’ll be logged out and will have little or no existing state.</p>

<p>However, sometimes <em>it just doesn’t go far enough</em>. Some of those news
websites have adapted, and in addition to counting the number of visits,
they’ve figured out how to detect private sessions and block them. I
haven’t looked into <em>how</em> they do this — maybe something to do with
local storage, or detecting previously cached content. Sometimes I want
a private session that’s <em>truly</em> fully isolated. The existing private
session features just aren’t isolated enough or they behave differently,
which is how they’re being detected.</p>

<p>Some time ago I put together a couple of scripts to brute force my own
private sessions when I need them, generally for testing websites in a
guaranteed fresh, fully-functioning instance. It also lets me run
multiple such sessions in parallel. My scripts don’t rely on any
private session feature of the browser, so the behavior is identical
to a real browser, making it undetectable.</p>

<p>The downside is that, for better or worse, no browser extensions are
carried over. In some ways this can be considered a feature, but a lot
of the time I would like my ad-blocker to carry over. Your ad-blocker is
probably <em>the</em> most important security software on your computer, so you
should hesitate to give it up.</p>

<p>Another downside is that both Firefox and Chrome have some irritating
first-time behaviors that can’t be disabled. The intent is to be
newbie-friendly but it just gets in my way. For example, both bug me
about logging into their browser platforms. Firefox starts with two
tabs. Chrome creates a popup to ask me to configure a printer. Both
start with a junk URL in the location bar so I can’t just middle-click
paste (i.e. the X11 selection clipboard) into it. It’s definitely not
designed for my use case.</p>

<h3 id="firefox">Firefox</h3>

<p>Here’s my brute force private session script for Firefox:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">#!/bin/sh -e</span>
<span class="nv">DIR</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">XDG_CACHE_HOME</span><span class="k">:-</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span><span class="p">/.cache</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
mkdir <span class="nt">-p</span> <span class="nt">--</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$DIR</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="nv">TEMP</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="k">$(</span>mktemp <span class="nt">-d</span> <span class="nt">--</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$DIR</span><span class="s2">/firefox-XXXXXX"</span><span class="k">)</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="nb">trap</span> <span class="s2">"rm -rf -- '</span><span class="nv">$TEMP</span><span class="s2">'"</span> INT TERM EXIT
firefox <span class="nt">-profile</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$TEMP</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="nt">-no-remote</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$@</span><span class="s2">"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It creates a temporary directory under <code class="highlighter-rouge">$XDG_CACHE_HOME</code> and tells
Firefox to use the profile in that directory. No such profile exists,
of course, so Firefox creates a fresh profile.</p>

<p>In theory I could just create a <em>new</em> profile alongside the default
within my existing <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.mozilla</code> directory. However, I’ve never liked
Firefox’s profile feature, especially with the intentionally
unpredictable way it stores the profile itself: behind random path. I
also don’t trust it to be fully isolated and to fully clean up when I’m
done.</p>

<p>Before starting Firefox, I register a trap with the shell to clean up
the profile directory regardless of what happens. It doesn’t matter if
Firefox exits cleanly, if it crashes, or if I CTRL-C it to death.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">-no-remote</code> option prevents the new Firefox instance from joining
onto an existing Firefox instance, which it <em>really</em> prefers to do even
though it’s technically supposed to be a different profile.</p>

<p>Note the <code class="highlighter-rouge">"$@"</code>, which passes arguments through to Firefox — most often
the URL of the site I want to test.</p>

<h3 id="chromium">Chromium</h3>

<p>I don’t actually use Chrome but rather the open source version,
Chromium. I think this script will also work with Chrome.</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">#!/bin/sh -e</span>
<span class="nv">DIR</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">XDG_CACHE_HOME</span><span class="k">:-</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span><span class="p">/.cache</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
mkdir <span class="nt">-p</span> <span class="nt">--</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$DIR</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="nv">TEMP</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="k">$(</span>mktemp <span class="nt">-d</span> <span class="nt">--</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$DIR</span><span class="s2">/chromium-XXXXXX"</span><span class="k">)</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="nb">trap</span> <span class="s2">"rm -rf -- '</span><span class="nv">$TEMP</span><span class="s2">'"</span> INT TERM EXIT
chromium <span class="nt">--user-data-dir</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$TEMP</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="se">\</span>
         <span class="nt">--no-default-browser-check</span> <span class="se">\</span>
         <span class="nt">--no-first-run</span> <span class="se">\</span>
         <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$@</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span>/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s exactly the same as the Firefox script and only the browser
arguments have changed. I tell it not to ask about being the default
browser, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">--no-first-run</code> disables <em>some</em> of the irritating
first-time behaviors.</p>

<p>Chromium is <em>very</em> noisy on the command line, so I also redirect all
output to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dev/null</code>.</p>

<p>If you’re on Debian like me, its version of Chromium comes with a
<code class="highlighter-rouge">--temp-profile</code> option that handles the throwaway profile
automatically. So the script can be simplified:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">#!/bin/sh -e</span>
chromium <span class="nt">--temp-profile</span> <span class="se">\</span>
         <span class="nt">--no-default-browser-check</span> <span class="se">\</span>
         <span class="nt">--no-first-run</span> <span class="se">\</span>
         <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$@</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span>/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In my own use case, these scripts have fully replaced the built-in
private session features. In fact, since Chromium is not my primary
browser, my brute force private session script is how I usually launch
it. I only run it to test things, and I always want to test using a
fresh profile.</p>
