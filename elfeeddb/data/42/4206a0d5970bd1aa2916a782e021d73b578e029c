A couple of days ago I wrote about on my lab grading workflow. In the post I mentioned that I used Emacs to easily navigate between student folders and files so I can actually look at their work in addition to their programs output and test results.
The key is a combination of dired and ag, Emacs's interface to the Silver Searcher which is something like a recursive code grep on steroids.
