Some of the videos I want to make are going to be much easier to do if I'm working in my own account where my whole file tree is available.
It's also a little annoying changing between my full emacs config and the one I'm developing here.
So, I decided to move to this config for my real config and as I make more videos move parts of my old configuration over to this new one.
