Writing about old projects got me thinking of my first programming gig and software longevity. It was a part time after school / full time summer job at Arcus-Simplex-Brown. I started in my senior year in high school and continued through most of my first year in college. It wasn't my first job - that was being a delivery boy at Video Room, an independent video store that's survived from the old VHS/Betamax days through DVDs and is still, somehow or other, surviving in this day and age of streaming video.
