In part 1, I talked about elfeed, a really awesome feed reader for emacs. Generally, I'm really liking it but there's been one problem - not being able to navigate quickly between groups of feeds with a keystroke or two.
It's emacs so there has to be a solution.
Enter hydra - a terrific emacs package from the same guy who brought us swiper, another one of my favorite emacs packages.
