 Some of our Ship Stewards (TAs) planning day one.   
 What's been happening since the close of the school year? We've been getting ready to start SHIP - CSTUY's first summer program.  SHIP will be running starting this Monday through the end of July and should be a great adventure. Fast facts: We have 47 students and 14 student teaching assistants (stewards)  We have 4 amazing teachers, 1 mentor for the TAs, me, and one official program mom.
