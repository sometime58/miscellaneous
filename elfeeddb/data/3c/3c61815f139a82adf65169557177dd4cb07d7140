div.center text-align:center;    This post is in response to an email thread on the NYTM mailing list. I mentioned how the NYC DOE refused to even look at our program at Stuy let alone support us and help us get to more kids.  Rather than pollute an email thread, I said I'd write up the story here.  I've been at the CS Ed game for a long time.
