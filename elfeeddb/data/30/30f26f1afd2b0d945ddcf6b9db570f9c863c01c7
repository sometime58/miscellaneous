Last week in my AP classes, we were working on inheritance.
So, what to do?
Last time around I had my classes work on a &ldquo;speed dating&rdquo; program - StuyDater. Back then JonAlf had his classes work on Stuyablo, that classic dungeon crawl.
I still plan on reworking the StuyDater project, but first I decided to do my take on Stuyablo. Of course, we&rsquo;ve improved on it. This time it&rsquo;s Stuyablo II.
