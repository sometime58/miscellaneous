Today was the last day of classes at Hunter thus ending my first semester of teaching at Hunter College.
I very much enjoyed the semester and my class and look forward to working with the same group when the spring term starts in a few weeks.
At the same time, even though I'm a quarter century veteran teacher, in many ways this was like my rookie season all over again.
