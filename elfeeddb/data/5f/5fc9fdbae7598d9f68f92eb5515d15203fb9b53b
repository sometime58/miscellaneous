Over on the CS Educator StachExchange, which is in private beta for a few more days, I saw a post asking about how to introduce the A* search algorithm.
I taught A* as part of the APCS class at Stuy so I thought I'd talk about what I did here.
Some time around mid year, we get to intermediate recursion. This is about the time, give or take, when we talk about the nlogn sorts.
