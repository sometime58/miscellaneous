 Having just concluded almost a quarter century at one job in one place, I've been reflecting on a number of things.  What I accomplished, what I've failed to accomplish, highlights, low lights and everything in between.  I've also learned a lot over these twenty five years.  One thing I learned is DevOps and System Administration.  Back around 1993 or 1994 Stuy wasn't really on the internet.
