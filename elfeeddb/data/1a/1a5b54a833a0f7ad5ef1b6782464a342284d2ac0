I&rsquo;ve never been a huge fan of the way we do varsity sports, and I say this as a guy that coached for a number of years. In NYC, we&rsquo;re governed by the Public School Athletic League or PSAL. Practice time and lack of facilities make teaching difficult, but my biggest problem is the fact that most teams cut, that is, if you&rsquo;re not in the top &ldquo;n,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re out. So, if our basketball team has, let&rsquo;s say 15 kids on it, they get exclusive use of the gym every afternoon during basketball season and no one else can receive coaching or be part of the team.
