Saw this tweet the other day so I though I would try to plug the Awesome CS Education list I started on GitHub:
#csteachers...didn&#39;t I see a list of CS teacher blogs here recently?

To answer the tweet, the closet thing I know to a list is Alfred Thompson's blog roll which is actually a post he wrote on his blog in 2012.
