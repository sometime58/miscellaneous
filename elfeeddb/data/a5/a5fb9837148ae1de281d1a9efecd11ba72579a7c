 I woke up this morning to an email from my principal "Stuy is #1." This followed a bunch of Facebook posts by friends and alums of a similar vein.  It was all about a couple of reports, here, and here. It turns out Stuy is ranked #1. Woo Hoo. We're awesome.  Of course, everyone whooping it up now was quick to say "all those rankings are meaningless"
