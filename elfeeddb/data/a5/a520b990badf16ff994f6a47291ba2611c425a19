Very little new Emacs in today's episode of Using Emacs. The video shows my old blogging workflow and what I'm playing with now.
The only new Emacs covered is the prodigy package which lets you run services under Emacs. I use it to run Nikola's development server but I think prodigy will also be useful when I start writing that knitting application I promised my wife.
When I started this blog, I used Jekyll.
