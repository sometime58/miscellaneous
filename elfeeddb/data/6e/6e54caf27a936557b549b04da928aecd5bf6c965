A little over a year ago, I decided it was time to reach out to my alums, a group I refer to as the &ldquo;Stuy CS family&rdquo; and try to get us together. The most rewarding part of my job involves the relationships I&rsquo;ve developed over the years but is was always between me and my alums and them to their classmates. This was an attempt to start building a network that spanned the years.
