This past weekend was Catskills Conf, one of my favorite events of the year.
Last year, Devorah joined me and also enjoyed the show.
If you know my wife, you know she's always knitting. Ok, not true, she's always knitting, spinning, weaving or performing some other form of fiber craft.
I can't complain. That's how I ended up with my Kandinsky, Dust Puppy and Yoda sweaters and my awesome Kang and Kodos socks.
