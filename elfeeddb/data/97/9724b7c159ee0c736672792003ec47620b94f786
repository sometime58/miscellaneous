About a month ago, I talked about using real data with our intro classes. After looking at the correlation between school&rsquo;s SAT scores and free and reduced lunch rates, it was time to turn the students loose.
The assignment: Find some interesting data out and do something with it. Make a web page that shows what you did and what you discoverde. We had already looked at the NYC Data Mine as well as a few other sources but students were encouraged to find new data sourcess.
