 Spent most of vacation relaxing. Finished off the remaining college recs, tried to catch up on sleep, and worked on a few project.  We've had an interesting December break dynamic in our household for the past few years. My son, Natan is very much into his music, both as a performer and a composer. A few years ago we discovered KlezKamp. It spoke to both Natan and Devorah.
