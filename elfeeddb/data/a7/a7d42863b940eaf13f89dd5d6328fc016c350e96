I won't be teaching my regular classes tomorrow. I'll be meeting all my kids but classes will only be 12 minutes long.  So, how will my colleagues and I spend the rest of the day?  Proctoring the PSAT.  This has always been a sore point with me. Back in the day, many schools, Stuy included, offered the PSAT on the weekend. If you wanted to proctor, you'd come in and get paid a little extra.
