Today figured to be one of our longer days mileage wise, we didn't think it would be that tough or tricky to navigate.
We checked out of our hotel at about 8:30 and hit the road. Streets through Syracuse, up a few hills towards the outskirts of town. Our directions and actual streets didn't quite jive so we had a little trouble finding our way back to the canal path, but once we did we figured it would be smooth sailing.
