I saw this headline earlier today: The U.S. Just Made a Bold Move to Improve Diversity in Tech.
The article talks about a program by which a number of code schools will be able to accept federal student aid. I don't know if we're talking student loans or grants but I'm not sure it matters.
The headline sounds great. I'm not so sure that this is a good thing.
My thinking's evolved over the years but right now, everything tells me that public funds and for profit education don't mix.
