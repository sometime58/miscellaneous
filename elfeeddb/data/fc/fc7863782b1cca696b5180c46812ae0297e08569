 Funny story from yesterday.  Devorah, my better half, is an assistant principal at another high school. Yesterday evening, she was at work late for "curriculum night." Parents came to the school after hours to hear a variety of presentations.  During her presentation, Devorah mentioned her name, that she had two former public school kids in college, and that's about it for the personal info.
