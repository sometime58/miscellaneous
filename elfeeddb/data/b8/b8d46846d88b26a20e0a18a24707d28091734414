The other day I discovered auto-yasnippet, another great package by Oleh Krehel or abo-abo.
It looks like it's going to be a great way to solve a particular problem that come up now and again.
There are plenty of times when I want to create a number of similar but slightly different blocks of text. The example on the project site is:
count_of_red = get_total(&#34;red&#34;); count_of_blue = get_total(&#34;blue&#34;); count_of_green = get_total(&#34;green&#34;);  You could use multiple cursors, a macro, or other methods to put in the common text but you still have to deal with the parts of each line that are unique, the red, green, and blue.
