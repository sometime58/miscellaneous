I got an email from my good friend and mentor this weekend. Danny Jaye, after 45 years, is finally retiring for real.
Danny, the Maestro, or Doc, as we sometimes called him spent most of his career at Stuyvesant. First as a math teacher, then math chair. Danny also spent time as the director of the Bergen Academies and his last few years as the Chief Academic Officer at Solomon Schecter in Bergen.
