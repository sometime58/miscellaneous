<p>Last two days I've been hacking on a small Emacs mode called <a href="https://github.com/sanel/declutter">declutter</a> and this will be the first version announcement.</p><p>What is <code>declutter</code> and why?</p><p>I often use Emacs to read long, online articles, which gives me plenty of options - I can save text for offline reading, I can read content with my favorite color and terminal setup, I have my shortcuts for fast navigation and so on.</p><p>However, modern sites are using more and more client-side rendering which doesn't play well with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eww.html">EWW</a>. Also, there is a recent trend I'm not really fan of, and that is putting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paywall">paywall</a> on anything worth of reading.</p><p>So, someone smart I'm not affiliated with, created <a href="https://outline.com">outline.com</a> service, which is able to solve above problems. At least most of it, which is perfectly fine with me. And that service is free to use, of course.</p><p><code>declutter</code>, in short, will use <code>outline.com</code> to get readable html content, including paywall protected sites straight from Emacs. Then it will render it in readable form in separate buffer.</p><p>So, I'm inviting you to try it, test it and let me know for your comments.  And please <a href="https://github.com/sanel/declutter/issues">report</a> if something breaks.</p><p>Enjoy!</p>
