Over the last few years, I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of people talk about curriculum.
&ldquo;We need a curriculum that works for everyone.&rdquo;
&ldquo;If we had a good curriculum, we could get CS in the schools.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you just take someone else&rsquo;s curriculum and scale things out?&rdquo;
People miss the point. In my twenty some odd years as an educator and my forty five as a human (including 18 as a parent), I&rsquo;ve never heard someone talk about that one inspirational curriculum that made all the difference in their lives.
