Most mornings, I start my day with a workout. Sometimes I run, sometimes I use my bike trainer. Dealing with plantar fasciitis since last June, it's mostly been the bike.
I occupy the time by either watching YouTube videos or catching up on Communications of the ACM or American Scientist. I'm about 6 months behind on both.
Inspired by some talk in one of the CS Ed Facebook groups, I thought I'd use the time to start going through some MOOCs.
