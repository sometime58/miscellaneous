This video will step you through setting up Emacs to use MELPA for packages.

We configured emacs by creating a folder named .emacs.d and creating a file within it named init.el.
Here's the contents of that file:
(setq inhibit-startup-message t) (require &#39;package)(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)(add-to-list &#39;package-archives &#39;(&#34;melpa&#34; . &#34;https://melpa.org/packages/&#34;))(package-initialize);; Bootstrap `use-package&#39; (unless (package-installed-p &#39;use-package)(package-refresh-contents)(package-install &#39;use-package)) (use-package try :ensure t) (use-package which-key :ensure t :config (which-key-mode))   The last two inituse-package clauses install two helpful packages: *try*: let's you try packages without installing them.
