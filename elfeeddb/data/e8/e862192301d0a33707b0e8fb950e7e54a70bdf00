Yesterday, I ranted on about the College Board. This led to a Facebook hosted discussion which got me thinking a little more:
Advanced Placement exams basically exist because we don't trust our high school teachers.
I usually use phrases like "society doesn't trust" but let's personalize it this time -- for parents, think about whether or not you trust your kids teachers? Do you a large private, unaccountable organization more?
