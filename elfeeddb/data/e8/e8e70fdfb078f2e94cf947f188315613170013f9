So, we&rsquo;re into the second year of my Software Development class. It&rsquo;s a little different since last time, I taught many of the kids in AP. This time, they&rsquo;re mostly new to me.
In AP, everything is low level. The students build linked lists, binary search trees, heaps, hash tables, graphs and the like. It&rsquo;s all about building the data structure. The Node, if you would.
We&rsquo;re about to start talking about databases.
