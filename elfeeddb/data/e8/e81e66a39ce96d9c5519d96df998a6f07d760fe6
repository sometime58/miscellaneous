I've been mostly underwater for the last couple of weeks.
End of term issues combined with the Academy of Software Engineering announcement has pretty much eaten up all of my out of class time.
It's going to be a week or so before I can finish writing the posts I was planning on, but it looks like a storm is brewing around Stuyvesant and Computer Science so I thought I'd put up this short semi-related post.
