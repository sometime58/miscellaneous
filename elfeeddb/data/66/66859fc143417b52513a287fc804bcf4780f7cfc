div.center {text-align:center;}    A good workman is known by his tools, or so the saying goes. My tools of choice are my terminal shell and Emacs.  I suppose if I was a full time developer working with a limited set of tools I might like an IDE like JetBrains or Eclipse but no matter how many alternatives I try, I always end back in Emacs.  I recommend that my students spend time not only in Emacs but also in tools like Vim or Sublime Text.
