Two days ago I asked the students, in small groups, to come up with a design to store a school (or school district) database.
Yesterday we discussed the designs.
All the students took our brand of AP Computer Science last year - a superset of the old AB curriculum and in that class they implemented a number of data structures such as binary search trees and hash tables, but they really didn&rsquo;t have an opportunity to design something more comprehensive.
