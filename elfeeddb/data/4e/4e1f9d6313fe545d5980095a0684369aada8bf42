One evening, many years ago, when I was in college, I had an epiphany. Maybe not as enlightening as the epiphany I had while watching "The Mummy Returns"&nbsp; many years later, but that's a story for another day.
While working on some class project, I realized that soon, within a couple of&nbsp; years, I'd be working for a real company and I'd actually have to write code that REALLY works. Not just something that gets past the grader, or answers all the test cases.
