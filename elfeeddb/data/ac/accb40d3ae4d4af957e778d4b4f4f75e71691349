Happy to be back after a couple of weeks.
My wife and son spent some time in San Francisco, Mountain View, and Seattle. The main reason was to see our daughter who's interning out there for the summer but it was also a great opportunity to catch up with over 100 former students. If you're interested in seeing more, I wrote a bit about it here.
I was originally going to start talking about Python development but then saw this post on reddit about reveal.
