<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Vim has the highly useful <code>\zs</code> and <code>\ze</code> regex extensions which specify the start and end of the match (see their full descriptions below).</p> <p>The effect of them is to put point right after <code>\zs</code> and for the match highlight to start right after <code>\zs</code> and end right before <code>\ze</code> (as applicable, if either is in the pattern).</p> <p>I find myself using <code>\zs</code> quite a lot when I want point to land somewhere after some boilerplate which is important for the match but which is unimportant for subsequent editing, or perhaps is just visually distracting.</p> <p>I&#39;m wondering if something like that is possible in Emacs regex as well?</p> <p>Here&#39;s how vim&#39;s <code>&quot;:help pattern.txt&quot;</code> describes them:</p> <pre><code>\zs Matches at any position, and sets the start of the match there: The next char is the first char of the whole match. Example: /^\s*\zsif matches an &quot;if&quot; at the start of a line, ignoring white space. Can be used multiple times, the last one encountered in a matching branch is used. Example: /\(.\{-}\zsFab\)\{3} Finds the third occurrence of &quot;Fab&quot;. \ze Matches at any position, and sets the end of the match there: The previous char is the last char of the whole match. Can be used multiple times, the last one encountered in a matching branch is used. Example: &quot;end\ze\(if\|for\)&quot; matches the &quot;end&quot; in &quot;endif&quot; and &quot;endfor&quot;. </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/trimorphic"> /u/trimorphic </a> &#32; to &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/"> r/emacs </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/9melgz/start_and_end_of_match_possible_in_emacs_regex/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/9melgz/start_and_end_of_match_possible_in_emacs_regex/">[comments]</a></span>
