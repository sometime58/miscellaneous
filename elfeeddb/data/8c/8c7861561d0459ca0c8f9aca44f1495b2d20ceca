The discussion today over on AVC was Chromebooks in K12, a title I conveniently lifted.
In the comments, I was asked my thoughts on chromebooks vs Linux on low end hardware so, here they are.
Chromebooks are cheap, near instant on, and, if you're using Google Apps for education, little to no administration necessary.
This is a HUGE win for schools.
There are some issues. School WiFi, for example, is frequently insufficient which can be a problem for a device that's meant to be connected to the cloud.
