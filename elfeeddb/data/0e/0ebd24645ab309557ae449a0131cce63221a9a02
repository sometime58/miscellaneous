 As a teacher, sometimes your gut tells you to do something and it turns out to be a really good idea.  That's what happened in October, 1994. I decided to dress up as Groo the Wanderer for Halloween. I never dressed in costume for school before and back then, no many did. A few students and very few teachers.  Afterwards, I noticed that my younger students - the ones that didn't know me that well yet, really loosened up and so a tradition was born.
