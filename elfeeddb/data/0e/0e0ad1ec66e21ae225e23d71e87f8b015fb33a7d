   The Hudson Valley's a beautiful place, particularly during the Fall. We don't get up there as much as we should - usually just for apple picking and then for the New York Sheep and Wool Festival.  It's a region with great food, hiking, natural beauty, history and more.  So, what exactly is growing?  The Hudson Valley Tech community.  I first heard about what Hudson Valley was doing around Tech back at the August New York Tech Meetup.
