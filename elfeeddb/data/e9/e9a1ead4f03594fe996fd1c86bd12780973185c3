div.center {text-align:center;}    We talked about setting kids up to fail in math. What about CS?  Well, it's a little subtler.  I started thinking about this after a conversation with one of my graduates about Harvard's famous CS50. Since that conversation, I've spoken to a number of my kids that have gone through CS50 and most seem to say the same things: They don't really teach anything  The kids rely on a group member who already knows stuff or will learn all the stuff on their own  If it weren't for my StuyCS background my group would have really struggled.
