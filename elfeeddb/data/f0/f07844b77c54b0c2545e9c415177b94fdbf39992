A week or so ago I wrote about the event we had to kick off Hunter College's partnering with the NY tech community to build a Hunter to tech pipeline. Each table had two Hunter students and a group of tech professionals. Each table discussed the Hunter CS experience and how the tech community can help support the students. Towards the end of the event a colleague commented that it was a great idea to have the students essentially run the tables and how effective it was.
