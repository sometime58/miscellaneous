Here's a really cool navigation method that I've been meaning to use more. Avy is a replacement for ace-jump mode which is an implementation of easymotion, a vim plugin.
It's pretty cool and lets you quickly navigate to any spot on the screen.
After triggering avy, or more specifically the **avy-goto-char** function, emacs prompts you for a single character. When you type it, all instances of the character that start out words change to a highlighted letter.
