  In a few hours Devorah and I will be off to our thirty year high school reunion. It's going to be a boat ride - reminiscent of those excursion day trips to Bear Mountain that Stuy had back in the day.  Having taught CS at Stuy for the last twenty plus years, I've also been invited to my share of reunions as a teacher.
