Yesterday, the Daedalus Scholars were visited by Peter Boyce. Peter's been a friend for years and is my go to guy when I'm looking talk startups, venture capital and many things tech. Peter's with General Catalyst Partners and is a co-founder of Rough Draft Ventures - a fund that invests in student entrepreneurs.
I'm teaching Hunter's first class of Daedalus Scholars - Hunter's new CS Honors program.
