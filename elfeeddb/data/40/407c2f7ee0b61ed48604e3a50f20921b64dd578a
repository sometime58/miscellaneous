I&rsquo;ve never been one for New Year&rsquo;s resolutions.
If I&rsquo;m working on something specific, I might set a goal to finish it, but the idea of goals for a year never struck a chord with me.
It&rsquo;s one of the things that I find absurd about the current teacher rating system - I have to decided on my three goals for the year. I always have one goal with respect to my profession - to be better at it.
