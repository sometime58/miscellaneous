On going back to work today Since school was still out due to Sandy, we ran a second online class yesterday. At the end of the session, which I&rsquo;ll summarize below, I told the class what I wanted them to accomplish today and over the weekend. One student queried &ldquo;you mean no class on Friday :-(?&rdquo; Alas no &ndash; while students aren&rsquo;t reporting to school this morning, teachers are.
