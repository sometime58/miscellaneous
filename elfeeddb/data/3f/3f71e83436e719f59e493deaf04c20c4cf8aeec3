Who is this man?
I showed this to Devorah last night and she immediately said "Hey, that's the metal filing guy!!!" Yes, you got it -- Wooly Willy!!! Everybody's favorite party toy.
Why did this come up? Well, yesterday, Rick put this together at work. So much for any productivity after that.
It's amazing all the time sinks you can throw together with just a few lines of code and NetLogo.
