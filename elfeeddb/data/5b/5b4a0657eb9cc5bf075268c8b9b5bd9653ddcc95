I wanted to write this up earlier but, as so frequently happens all my dormant work projects decided it was time to rise up and demand instant attention.
When we left off, we had students pulling code and submitting homework via github.
Form here, it's an easy step to have them working on a small project in their own repo. In fact, sometimes, I'll jump right to a two person project where one person creates the repo and invites the other (and me) as a collaborator.
