So here we are starting the new year and NY City is rolling out its new teacher evaluation system.
It was all over the news last year.
Ultimately, the state imposed the plan.
The city hailed the new plan as a way to fire under-performing teachers.
The UFT president hailed the plan as something that &ldquo;is designed to help teachers improve their skills&hellip;.&rdquo;
My take? All three parties have thrown the students and teachers under the bus.
