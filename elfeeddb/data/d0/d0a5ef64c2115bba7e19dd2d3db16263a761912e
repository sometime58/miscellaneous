I've been following the tweets coming out of ICER2018. I've never been to ICER but now am thinking about trying to get funding to go next year. One set of tweets involved students writing or using APIs or Libraries. This overlaps with Owen Astrachan's talk from this past year's CSTA conference on sorting. I was planning on writing a post about Owen's talk but I thought I'd leave it for the school year closer to when sorting is typically covered.
