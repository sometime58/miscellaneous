I just wanted to announce that I recently adopted <a href="https://github.com/kidd/org-gcal.el">org-gcal</a>.<br /><br />This great emacs mode imports google calendar events to your org files, and has some support for exporting events to your google calendars.<br /><br />The <a href="https://github.com/myuhe">author</a> went missing in action for more than a year, and there were some nasty bugs in master that made the initial experience quite disappointing.  Most of the bugs had Pull Requests opened, but still pending to be merged.  So I decided to adopt the package to give it some love, and since last week, the melpa link points to my repo instead of  @myuhe's.<br />  <br />Big props to the original author and also the many users of the module that helped with the migration.<br /><br />If you use org-gcal, my recommendation is to update the package, and it will only improve your experience.    There's an ongoing <a href="https://github.com/kidd/org-gcal.el/pull/14">big refactoring</a> that uses oauth2.el to manage all the tokens and oauth, but it still have issues that I haven't figured out how to solve in an elegant way.<br /> Of course, if you have suggestions (or even better, code) for org-gcal, please direct them to https://github.com/kidd/org-gcal.el .
