Earlier today I read Garth Flint's latest post on choosing a Python environment for his classes. While our classes and populations are different it looks like Garth and I share a lot of thoughts on the subject.
I started to write a comment to leave on Garth's blog but since it was getting a little long I thought I'd write it up as a post.
The question of development environment can be an important one and can make a big difference.
