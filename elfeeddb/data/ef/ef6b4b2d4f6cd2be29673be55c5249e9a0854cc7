 Yesterday, my buddy Stan pointed me to this article: "To address techâ€™s diversity woes, start with the vanishing Comp Sci classroom"  It gives a reasonable overview of the gender issues in computer science education. The article talks about the drop in popularity of the old Advanced Placement AB course and its eventually being dropped as well as thoughts on how the current A course is pretty dry.
