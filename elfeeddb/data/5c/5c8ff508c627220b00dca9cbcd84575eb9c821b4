Our hackers have been coming down to SumAll every Saturday for a while now. It&rsquo;s a great space and we&rsquo;ve been given run of the office. That said, the hackers really had no idea what SumAll is all about.
Today, we had our first guest speaker. Davin Chew, founder and CTO of SumAll. Davin&rsquo;s also a member of the StuyCS family, he was my student back in the nineties. When Davin heard we needed space for our Saturday program, he and the SumAll team graciously offered to host.
