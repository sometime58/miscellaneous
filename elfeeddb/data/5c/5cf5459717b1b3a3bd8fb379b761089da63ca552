 Just completed the second time through for my Software Development course. Last year we had a great time at our Demo Night hosted at Google.  This year, unfortunately, due to a variety of reasons, we couldn't get the event together. Still, the kids did great work so I thought I'd share.  This year, I asked each group to make a short video.  First up, we've got bit&lt;&lt;shift - a search engine for code.
