 About a month ago, I was at my 30 year high school reunion. Yesterday I was at the class of 2009's 5 year one. Stuy 2004 also had their 10 year reunion last night.  It's always nice to be invited to reunions - I know it's largely dependent on who's on the organizing committee but it's nice to be remembered.  Last time I wrote about Stuy reunions I noted how similar they all are.
