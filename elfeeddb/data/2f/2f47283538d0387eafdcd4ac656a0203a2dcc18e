<p>For a while one of the biggest complaints people had about
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile">Projectile</a> was that the
<code>alien</code> indexing wasn’t fast enough (especially on big projects). The
reason for the (relatively) bad performance was pretty simple - even
though Projectile would normally obtain the list of project files
pretty fast (e.g. by using <code>git ls-files</code>) it always did some
post-processing of the results (e.g. filtering, sorting, etc), which
is a very slow operation in Elisp on a big dataset.</p>

<p>Today I’ve added <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/commit/e3007ae0324fb6679a6b3dac5c63191ce907115e">a new indexing
method</a>
that simply dispenses with all of the post-processing and gives you
the raw power you always craved for. It’s called <code>turbo-alien</code> (yeah,
yeah - naming is hard!) and it’s going to be the default indexing
method going forward (starting with Projectile 1.1 which should be released pretty soon).</p>

<p>You can read a bit more about it in Projectile’s
<a href="https://www.projectile.mx/en/latest/configuration/#project-indexing-method">manual</a>.</p>

<p>If you find yourself missing Projectile’s old behaviour just add the following to your config:</p>

<figure class="code"><span></span><div class="highlight"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="cl"><span class="line"><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">projectile-indexing-method</span> <span class="ss">'alien</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>The old tried and true <code>alien</code> method is still around, it’s just no longer the default.</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> I encourage all of you to help out with some of the <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/issues">open tickets</a>
marked with “Help Wanted” or “Good First Issue” here. I’m trying to
clean-up shop after a long period of stagnation and I can certainly
use some help! :-)</p>

<p><strong>P.P.S.</strong> The recent 1.0 release was just a precursor to some bigger changes I
had planned to do for quite a while. Stay tuned for more updates!</p>
