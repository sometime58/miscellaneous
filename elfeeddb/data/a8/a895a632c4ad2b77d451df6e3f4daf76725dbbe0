  We're almost at the end of CSTUY SHIP's first journey. The Shipmates and stewards will be showing off their work in another day or so and I'm excited to see their finished projects.  But what toolset are they using.     With knew we would be working with two rooms of relative beginners. We needed something that allowed us to develop the shipmates CS skills while also having a low cost of entry.
