 Miranda and Nadia showing off their project 
  Tomorrow is the last day of SHIP and we'll be capping the whole thing off with a day of demos, science fair style.  Both the shipmates and the stewards will be showing off their work and I can't wait. I've intentionally stayed away from the shipmates because I want to be surprised but I've seen what the stewards have been doing and I can't tell you how proud I am of their work.
