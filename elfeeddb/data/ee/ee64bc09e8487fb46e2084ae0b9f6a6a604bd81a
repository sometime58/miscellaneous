Both at and prior to SIGCSE 2017, I promised to write up the steps I take to introduce and use revision control systems in my classes.
This series is not meant to be a git or GitHub tutorial. There are plenty of those already (two of which I've linked to below). This is about the process I use with my students to get them up to speed.
As with any new tool, there will be some resistance but once git saves them once, they get religion.
