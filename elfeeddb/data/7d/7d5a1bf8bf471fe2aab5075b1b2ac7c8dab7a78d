I originally planned on do some videos on C++ development but I'm just not feeling it. Probably because I'm excited to be working with my new class and we're working in Python. We're not going to be using C+++ for a few months so I'll get to those videos a little later.
Today, I want to cover what I consider a leatherman or multi-tool for Emacs. Something that isn't perfect for any particular job but can get almost any job done: Macros.
