Yesterday was my 46th birthday. How did I spend it? Well, 20 &ldquo;Hackers&rdquo; from 9 schools, 4 student TAs and a few of us teachers gathered at SumAll to kick off CSTUY&rsquo;s first weekly program - Hacking Sessions (sometimes called Hackers Sessions).
  It was the first week so it was mostly mixers, setting up machines (installing Linux on 24 laptops takes time) and going over how we&rsquo;ll be communicating but I&rsquo;m really excited about the weeks to come.
