 When I first saw the quicksort it was in an algorithms class back in the day. We first learned the quicksort, then choosing a good pivot element and then as an afterthought we did quickselect.  Fast forward to teaching. I was never really happy teaching quicksort. Mergesort is easy to motivate and it's pretty easy to write. Quicksort always felt a little forced.
