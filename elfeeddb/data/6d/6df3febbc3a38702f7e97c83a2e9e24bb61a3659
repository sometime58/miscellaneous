Each month, The Stuyvesant school paper - the Spectator invites a teacher to write a piece on, well, basically, whatever they want to. I did it this past month.
Here&rsquo;s a reposting of the piece. The original can be found on the Spectator site.
Enjoy
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got 10 periods of class and no lunch.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got four APs.&rdquo; &ldquo;Can I also take Great Books, Multivariate, Physics C, and Software Development?&rdquo; The goal of a Stuyvesant student: take as many electives and AP classes as possible.
