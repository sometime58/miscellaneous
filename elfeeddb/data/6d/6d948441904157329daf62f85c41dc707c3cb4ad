A few weeks ago, I noticed this Twitter conversation between Alfred Thompson and Steve Keinath

I&#39;d love to see an Intro to Linux (way more than just install) as a 3-hour workshop at #CSTA14 @csteachersa
&mdash; Steve Keinath (@keinath) November 12, 2013 @alfredtwo @csteachersa Right. I know very little &amp; would love a &quot;zero to hero&quot; Linux workshop.

I briefly considered proposing a session for the conference but it was just a day or two before the deadline, I don't know if I'm going to be able to attend the conference, and besides, who said anything I proposed would be accepted.
