Like many of my fellow bloggers and tweeters, I generally keep this site clear of political issues with the exception of those that are directly related to education.
Also, like many of my fellow bloggers and tweeters, this week has provided a reason to break with that tradition.
Many people, including some friends, all more eloquent than I have already posted, tweeted, and Facebooked about the behavior of our President and government.
