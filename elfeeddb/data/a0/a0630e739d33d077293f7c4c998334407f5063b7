Today I had the privilege of attending my second live State of the City address. Mayor Bloomberg didn&rsquo;t spend as much time on education as he did at last year&rsquo;s address but he did take a moment to give a shout out to charter schools. It gets old hearing the same false story about how charters are better than public schools. At least we have people like Gary Rubinstein and Diane Ravitch trying to set the record straight.
