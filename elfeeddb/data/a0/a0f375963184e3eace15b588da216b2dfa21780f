When looking for assignments for our classes, in addition to trying to craft assignments that develop and reinforce key ideas, we also strive to come up with ideas that &ldquo;speak&rdquo; to the students and keep their interest. We write small games, use problems within the student&rsquo;s experiences, and in general try to find problems that are appealing.
This is much easier to do when the kids can read data from a file.
