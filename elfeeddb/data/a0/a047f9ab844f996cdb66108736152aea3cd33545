Spent the past few days at the Tapia Conference in Seattle.
The Tapia conference is billed as a &ldquo;Celebration of Diversity in Computing.&rdquo; The bulk of the attendees seemed to be students. Undergrads and grads. The undergrads were mostly juniors and seniors, but a bunch of freshmen and sophomores were there as well. Of course there were faculty members to join them as well as people from industry.
What was I doing there?
