 Just had an interesting conversation with Chris, one of our CSTUY mentors. Chris is working with one of our more advanced groups of hackers - they'll be creating a web based app that with ultimately be deployed as mobile using PhoneGap.  The question he had was "Angular.js or Backbone.js."  Chris and I have had this conversation before. I was explaining at the time why I preferred to use Backbone.
