 Time to wrap up sorting for a while. We just finished quicksort having gone through a series of lessons We started with Quickselect.  Then we did a quicksort, copying to new arrays during the partition  Then finally to an in place quicksort.  
 For the final quicksort we used a partition algorithm pretty much the same as the one described here.  We started testing using by building a randomly filled array like this: Random rnd = new Random(); int a[] = new int[n]; for (int i0;i&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #7CB8BB;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;;i++) { a[i]  rnd.
