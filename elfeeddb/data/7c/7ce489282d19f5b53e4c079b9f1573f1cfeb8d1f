Day 3. From Lockport to Brockport.
Lockport is "famous" for it's locks -- the two channel 5 step ones. Brockport is famous for it's... brocks?
After a reasonable nights sleep and breakfast at Hambleton House, our BnB, we were off.

&nbsp;Here's one of the many lift bridges that cross the canal. Right now it's down. It's raised when a boat has to pass under. Back in the day, as there was much less road traffic, the bridges stayed in the raised position so boats and barges could pass.
