If you use emacs, you should keep an eye on Jon Snader's blog, irreal.org. A few days he posted on Undo Tree - a package that extends Emacs's built in undo functionality.
Basic emacs has undo, bound to C-/ or C-_ but that's about it. Undo tree, which you can set up with:
(use-package undo-tree :ensure t :init (global-undo-tree-mode))  adds two key features. First is redo, which you get by adding the shift key to the undo keychords.
