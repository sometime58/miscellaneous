Last week was crazy. Busy, stressful, late night after late night. It ended, though, on a great note.
A young lady in my intro class found me in my office near the end of the day:
 Student: Mr. Z, I wanted to make sure to catch you before vacation!
Me: What&rsquo;s up?
Student: I wanted to tell you that today&rsquo;s lesson was AWESOME!!!!!!
 Wow. I&rsquo;ve been teaching 23 years and that&rsquo;s never happened before!
