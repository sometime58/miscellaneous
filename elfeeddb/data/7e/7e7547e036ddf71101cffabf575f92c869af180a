Yesterday we left Seneca Falls and headed back north up to Syracuse. Our fifth day in a row of riding. Figured it could be one of the tougher days between the changing terrain and the return of the heat and humidity.&nbsp; Apparently, there's no shade in northern NY.
Turned out to be true. The first part of the ride was mostly on road. Easy surface, but up and down.&nbsp; When we got to the old canal path, it was more gravely than crushed stone.
