Everybody know's I'm the Statler and Waldorf of the CS Education world.

I've been known to be "prickly," which is a nice way of putting it and I'm openly critical of many programs out there.
One program, however, that I very much like is TEALS. They've been around since 2009 founded by Kevin Wang, a former teacher. The basic idea was to have tech professionals go to a school on the way to work and team teach a CS class with one of the school's teachers.
