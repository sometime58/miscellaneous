I've always lamented the fact that we don't have the time or structure to really teach our kids to program.
In their early classes, they learn syntax, algorithms, and &nbsp;some ways of storing data and while they &nbsp;will probably work on some larger projects as they study CS, kids seem to be mostly left on their own in terms of how to take a project from problem or idea to completion.
