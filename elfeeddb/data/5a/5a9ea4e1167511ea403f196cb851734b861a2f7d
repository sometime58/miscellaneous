It turns out that Elpy, a popular emacs package for python development is much easier to set up than I remember. It turns out all you need is:
(use-package elpy :ensure t :config (elpy-enable))  The video shows how to install and a bit of use. I don't think it's a package I'm going to use much since I use other tools to do similar things but it's worth checking out.
