Those laptops that my Hunter students were supposed to get have finally arrived. We're distributing them on Monday. Each student will have a Dell laptop running Ubuntu 16.04 for as long as they're in the program.
This means we can finally start using the web as a way of displaying and sharing our projects.
For this type of web development, I'm a big fan of using Flask. Flask is a Python microframework.
