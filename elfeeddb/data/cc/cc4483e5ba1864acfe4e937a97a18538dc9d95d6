 The other day, Alfred Thompson put up a piece about coding in multiple languages. Alfred references a post written last May by Rob Underwood.  Both pieces are worth a look.  Rob is trying to illustrate many of the superficial similarities in popular languages.  In the comments on Alfred's blog, both Alfred and I alluded to coding in an appropriate style for the language.
