Saw this post the other day: Emacs is hurting Clojure and this response: Is Emacs Really HJard to Learn / Use.
This called to mind those countless discussions about tools being user friendly. I'm frequently on the unpopular side of these discussions. Linux vs Windows vs Mac, Shell vs GUI, Emacs vs fill-in-the-blank-editor-or-IDE and on and on.
Don't use Emacs, it isn't user friendly. Don't use Linux, it isn't user friendly.
