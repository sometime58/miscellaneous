Today was the first day of school for all NYC teachers. Students come back tomorrow. That's a quick turnaround. Some years, they get a day or two before the kids come in. That's much easier.
The first day is usually dominated by meetings. In a large school like Stuy you'll typically have a long faculty meeting in the morning and a department meeting in the afternoon. Not much time to actually get ready for classes.
