I spent the last couple of days attending Personal Democracy Forum 2016, described on their landing site as:
  The worldâ€™s leading conference exploring and analyzing technology's  impact on politics, government, and society.  That's the reason why I haven't posted my latest Emacs video.
PDF is a great conference and raised a huge number of important issues. I'll probably blog about a few over the next few weeks.
