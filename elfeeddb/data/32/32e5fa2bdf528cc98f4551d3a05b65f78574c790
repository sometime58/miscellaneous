We just got back from a few days in Montreal.
Love the city - it&rsquo;s walkable, lots of good food, love the waterfront, history, and lots to do.
I also love seeing a city using a bike/walking combo. In a car, you speed by things too fast and parking&rsquo;s always a problem. Foot alone doesn&rsquo;t let you cover enough ground. By bike, you&rsquo;re slow enough to see things but fast enough to get from place to place.
