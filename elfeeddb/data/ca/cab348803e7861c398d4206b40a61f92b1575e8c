<p>I started hacking on this a while back but Iâ€™ve finally done the house-keeping tasks required to make it a proper grown up package.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/stsquad/dired-rsync">dired-rsync</a> is a simple command which you can use to trigger an rsync copy from within dired. This is especially useful when you want to copy across large files from a remote server without locking up Emacs/Tramp. The rsync just runs as an inferior process in the background.</p>
<p>Today was mainly a process of cleaning up the CI and fixing any issues with it. Iâ€™d still like to add some proper tests but the whole thing is interactive and that seems to be tricky for Emacs to test. Anyway Iâ€™ve now tagged 0.4 so it will be available from MELPA Stable once it rebuilds. You can of course grab the building edge from MELPA any time <img alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f609.png" style="height: 1em;" /></p>
