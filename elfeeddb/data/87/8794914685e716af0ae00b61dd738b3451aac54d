I'll be traveling for the next couple of weeks so I probably won't have time for another video until mid to late July. I'll probably write a post about this series and do some regular blogging over that time but probably no new videos for a couple of weeks.
 Also, a couple of notes about the series: Instead of making a separate git branch for each episode, I'm just adding on to the master branch on GitHub.
