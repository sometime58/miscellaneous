I like a fairly informal atmosphere in my classes. Students have to know that there&rsquo;s a line between teacher and student but I also want them to feel like we&rsquo;re all part of the Stuy CS family.
Whenever we start a new term, it takes a while to break down the walls. The students don&rsquo;t know what to expect of me, can they trust me? Am I a bozo? Who knows.
