Hi Joseph,

This is the link to the video we watched in class last Friday (
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s608077NtNI). It's a comprehensive
demonstration on Ainsworth's research we were talking about last lesson and
I found it a useful piece of resource to give you an idea of what was done
and what the purpose of her research was. Email me if you have any
questions after watching or ask me in person next time.

Have a good one.
Aohan
