Hello Lachy,



I realise now I should=92ve stayed at home lying on bed yesterday instead o=
f
going out. now the aftermath of hanging outside under -10 degree is
certainly taking its toll and I=92m buried in regret and deep sickness. I
know that I have to stay in bed and drink only hot water, but somehow I
went outside and bought two whole bottles of coke and ate chocolate for
lunch. Now the headache and running nose are killing me and I=92m trying my
bestest to keep my eyes open and take in some dumplings. It=92s the arrival
of winter according to Chinese lunar calendar and having dumplings is part
of the tradition. Yum.



With body temperature going up to 38 I=92m dazzled and all drained of my
physical strength. I=92m writing to you with computer on my lap. I find thi=
s
half laying position particularly killing my back. But I don=92t think ther=
e
would be any position comfortable with me anyways (haha). I tried to read
something but couldn=92t really keep my attention focused on one point for
long under bodily condition like this. This is the first time I=92ve been
sick for this whole year and who could=92ve thought I can be this bad.



I played will and grace this whole day but didn=92t even bother to watch.
Most of the time I felt half asleep and wandering between fuzzy awakeness
and distant sleeping state. Consciousness is really an interesting mental
state. During real conscious period we think of ourselves as reasonable
beings who use logic to pursue truth. But after science having progressed,
modern psychologists try to figure out the truth about our brain and
thought by studying sub- and unconsciousness. There was a certain moment
when I thought I heard some voice coming to me as if there was someone at
my bedside telling me a story or reading me verses from a book. It was
about time I spent with my granny when we used to live in countryside far
from Beijing city. It=92s amazing how these things come together in our min=
d
purely from human=92s capacity of memory. How wonderful creatures we are to
memorise things taken place years ago and sometimes they could turn out to
be so vivid in dreams that makes you in deep confusion wondering about
which one to be the truth. It=92s such a spectacular gift among all we are
offered and I regard it as a blessing as every time we are put to deep
sadness we have always somewhere to hide and to be sheltered.



As for now, I can=92t stop thinking about you. And when I=92m submerged in =
deep
emotional indulgence of missing you there=92s part of me cured miraculously
and the pains gone. Haha. Hope you=92ve had a nice day and everything went
well.



Kisses & Misses

Alberto
