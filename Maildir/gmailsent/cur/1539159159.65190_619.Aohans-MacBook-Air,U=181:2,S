Hi Adam,

The attendance has been alright. Around 8, 9 people every week. Not really
as high as I expected but I've heard from Abby that it seems like most
students aren't fresh new to the language, so they tend to go to the
post-beginner's. Nothing to worry too much really, at least not for our
class.

It's the second semester, so lower attendance is somewhat expected. I'll
work hard on keeping students staying and hopefully we don't have lots of
leavers in our classes as last semester. Keep up with the good work.

Best,
Aohan
