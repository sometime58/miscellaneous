Hello Lach,

I'm getting on the plane in a few hours. Just a quick email. As you know I'l=

ee from the group work. I don't want to disturb you so don't feel uneasy if y=
ou are too busy and don't have time available:-) also I don't know if my old=
 cell number is still working properly so I'll be on skype all day and check=
ing my email much just to get in touch.=20

Albert
