Dear Lach,



I=92m back home in Beijing finally thank goodness. It=92s been certainly an
exhausting experience travelling that far for that long (and it=92s not doi=
ng
me anything good financially by the way). how I find about my travelling
you asked? Not so interesting to be honest. The disadvantage of travelling
with other people is that you don=92t usually (or say, seldom) have time on
your own. When disagreement occurs, I=92m always the one that compromise.
Travelling with other two girls is even worse. They have all kinds of
requirements about where to go, what to do and what to eat and that really
gets on my nerves from time to time. We are all good friends in real life.
That makes it even harder to say that you feel unhappy about their picky
taste. But after all I feel refreshed after the venture. It makes me
realise that I don=92t need to travel to anywhere else in china at all as
they may all seem like the same in every aspect. So next time what I=92d do
is going to a restaurant and order from a certain cuisine and that=92s enou=
gh
lol. What a valuable lesson for me.



Coming back to Beijing took about 3 hours of flight. There was a guy
sitting right next to me and oh my god what was that smell! Does he ever
groom himself even a little?  Does he do any body cleaning at all? I hate
being around such people. It seems they never realise that one=92s personal
hygiene is not only their own issue but a matter of showing respect to
others. I finished one book on logic the way going over there and coming
back. This seems to be the most valuable thing in my trip. But I rather
find it even harder to keep my attention focused for a long period of time
recently. Regardless of all sorts of distractions around me as they usually
are there, I become more frequently mind-wandering all the time. I tried to
meditate to calm myself down and to go with my strand of thought but end up
astray again. Those thoughts come as pieces and rather hard to get hold of
before it=92s completely gone. What happened to me?



Speaking of books, I=92ve finished reading all three books you gave me.
Agatha one is good as expected. I don=92t really get the woodhouse one. I
think it=92s just the style of writing I=92m not so used to. It has a rathe=
r
academic tone but after all tells the story of something not of serious
importance. I=92ll probably go through it again see if it=92ll be any diffe=
rent
from the first time. But not any time soon as what I=92m gonna tell you now=
.



The Spring Festival, aka Chinese New Year, is coming! The biggest day of
the year and supposedly the happiest time as well. Family dinners,
relatives getting together, rumours going all over, being asked to make
some critical progress in my romantic life. Sounds like plenty of fun to
me! It=92ll become such a huge challenge for me to put my happy face on and
take in all of those prying, annoying words without shouting something
nasty back. Well it=92s tradition, so I=92ll get used to it, one day. But t=
o
look on a bright side, I get to reunion with people I haven=92t been meetin=
g
for quite a while. My cousins are coming back, and certainly I can
anticipate a lot of interesting conversations then about our adventures
over this year. My grandpa=92s birthday happens to be exactly the Chinese N=
ew
Year=92s Eve according to the chinese lunar calendar, so every year there
will be a huge dinner celebrating it. it=92s coming in 3 days and I really
look forward to it. my grandpa=92s turning 78 this year! Yeah!



It=92s nice to hear that you=92ve come back on good terms with Mari. That
woman. Always a mystery to me. Hard to look through. Hope life back in
Melbourne is treating you with good. I can=92t wait to go back to see you a=
nd
I miss you so much. So bad there=92s still a month left. But we=92ve alread=
y
made past two months. It=92s incredible! Time does fly!



I should take you to chinese restaurants more (or perhaps cook for you)
after I=92m in Melbourne again. You=92ll see how amazing they taste like.
Totally different from ones of western taste and can be definitely
adventurous experience. I=92d say not all things you can find in china town
are that =91chinese=92. The true chinese food is more than that.



I don=92t need to stress again how much I=92ve been missing you. Sometimes =
I
walk on the street and I see people walking by me and all in a sudden, I
think about you, I imagine how wonderful it=92d be having you right next to
me. Wind blowing, and cars shrieking. I think about you, as so deeply, and
as always.



Take care. And, even though knowing you don=92t celebrate it, happy Chinese
New Year!

Albert
