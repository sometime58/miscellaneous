Dear Lach,



How I've been missing you so much lately. Yes, yes, I've been on bed the
past few days again, due to the cold. It's certainly been killing me the
weather in Beijing. Getting cold suddenly then slowly warm. I didn't spend
much time outside. In fact, I lay on my bed most of the day, reading, or
sometimes watching a few movies. (of course some episodes of Will and Grace
too ahaha)



Now I'm already packing my stuff, getting ready for my arrival at Melbourne
again. It's exciting but I get panicked as I told you. I don't know if
it'll be scarily busy the next semester. I hope I can get along well with
my subjects ahead.



I'm happy you suggested we could study together. It'll be good to have
study partner just to sit together and read on separate books. I tried that
with Thomas but he talks much. I find it hard to concentrate when there is
someone next to me talking to me. So I've been studying in Ballieu library
by myself. I think subjects are going to get more interesting as they would
become more detailed in branch theories on the same area I did for the
first year. Along with it would be more things to remember for the test of
course. I'm going to do a course the study of Australia Native Culture for
media, which will be challenging for me seeing I know nothing about
Australian culture (if summer heights high doesn't count lol). Wish there's
much I can get from this course and at the end of the semester, I can lay
some comments on the issues related to Australia Nation.



I think it's good you have this mysterious feeling you incur in others.
This helps you keep a healthy distance in your relationships. Sometimes it
could be appearing cold though, but mostly it's fine. I personally
appreciate the room in between a relationship so it's easy to catch a
breath when there's friction. As I may have told you I'm really bad at
dealing with confrontation. Most of the time I just keep quiet or run away.
I don't have the gut like you to be facing up with people like Mari. If she
does anything not in my term, I perhaps will back off and find a quieter
place on my own.



Complaining isn't a bad thing. Instead, it's good for your health to let
out your negative emotions. I'm willing to hear you complain haha. It'll be
interesting to know about the dramas going on in your life. So don't
hesitate to tell me anything you feel happy to be sharing. I happen to be
known to my friends as a good listener lol. It's perhaps I don't have much
to tell about my life so I like to hear about others.



It's 3 am but I can't fall asleep as I spent all of my day sleeping today
(oh it's yesterday now). this I don't remember how many times I have caught
a cold. It seems I'm starting to get used to not being in my best body
situation. Lucky for me it gives me a good reason to lie on bed doing
nothing at all. I always stare at the wall above my bedroom, mind
wandering. Sometimes I'd come up with a story like in a movie. I can write
a whole book about my day dream had I got some time. But I'm lazy at
writing lately. Not so productive a writer I can make haha.



About that cd. Actually the title was a joke lol. John Mayer is definitely
not a square. Have you heard about his new relationship with Katy Perry?
Two of my favourate singers have come together. That's really a great piece
of news. It's funny to see how pop stars get involved in relationships so
quickly, like they take no time to recover from the wound of last one and
move on a whole new page. It's been said artists are special. Meanwhile
they are gifted in particular area, they behave quite unusual in other
aspects.



It's amazing thinking about there's only few days' time before we can meet.
I can't wait to see you. It's been three whole months. How have I made it
such a long period of time!



The penguin is sitting right next to me on my bed. I wouldn't need him for
long as I'm about to have the real one. Lol.



Take good care of yourself, I'll be there soon

Albert
