Hi Sophie,

Sorry I forgot to email you that the transfer has been done. I'm right now
packing my stuff and I'm getting on the plane tomorrow in the afternoon.
I'll be arriving the next day. Nice to see you in two days time. And thank
you for telling me about our new roommate.

Looking forward to seeing you too
Albert
