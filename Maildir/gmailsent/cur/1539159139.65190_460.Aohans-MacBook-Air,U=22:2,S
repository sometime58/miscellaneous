Hey Lachy,



You are probably still squeezing in your grandparents=92 garage with the
other three right now and in your sleep already. I just came back from my
old classmates New Year=92s party. It was a few days earlier before the
actual New Year=92s day but we still had a great deal of fun and the party
was a huge blast.



I=92ve been in a kind of project helping troublesome adolescent these days.
it=92s just that we (my mom and I) were asked by a colleague of my dad=92s =
to
help try to talk to his son, as, alleged, we are =91the only people he=92s
willing to have conversation with=92. ( fyi the two families are good frien=
ds
and we used to be having family dinner all time before) This boy of 15 year
old is a trouble. He=92s rude and impervious to any kinds of helpful kindne=
ss
and rather hard to talk to. The seemingly only interest of his is the way
he dresses and how other people look. Also he=92s do divulged in outfits an=
d
lifestyles and so on, and doesn=92t care about anything more than superfici=
al
matters. He looks so arrogant and it always seems like he=92s not into
talking to us whatsoever, which really gets on my nerves. We weren=92t so
eager to help after all and it seems like he is so not helpable as the
problem he has traces back to some wrong ways of teaching back five or six
years ago, which should the problem between him and his parents. Looking at
him, all in a sudden it got me think how important education is and how
parental companion is crucial to a child from the very beginning. I find
the huge impact a parent can ever have upon their children and after years
of being together kids learn from their folks in terms of how to behave.
Right now, this kid is hopeless of being helped as no vocal suggestions and
lecturing can ever be working out on him. He is not going to take any
advice from anybody at all. He brought up that fact the past few days that
he wanted to quit school and study no more. He also said studying gets him
dazzled and uncomfortable. Even things like reading and doing maths give
him great emotional burden and render him nauseated physically. And when it
comes to what it is he wants to do for his life, he doesn=92t have any idea=
.
This is dangerous that he thinks of life as meaningless and filled with
boredom. I don=92t know if there is anything I could possibly do to help hi=
m.
Perhaps nothing at all. I just selfishly think that it=92s not me causing h=
is
problems at the first place so I=92ve got no responsibility and capacity to
help him for good. And if there isn=92t anything I can ever do to help, I=
=92ll
just step back and admit my limitation of helping others. We are only human
right?



I=92ve seen a lot of people educating their kids with the wrong technique. =
I
don=92t mean to say I=92ve know all the truth about the =91correct educatio=
n=92
seeing that there will never be a best way of doing it. But some certain
things I will regard as =91must do=92 or =91should never do=92. And raising=
 kids is
all about caring them and having time together. All sorts of manners and
behaviours and the ways they think and look at things come from the
influence of their parents being with them years after years. As I may have
told you in my letters before, I always think the goal of education is not
to let them have great deal of income after they get a job, but to help and
guide them to come to know how to pursue true happiness. No matter how much
money you earn and what kind of thing you do, you always make the best of
you life and can be happy even though going through hard times. And most of
all, help them know how to think and to make their own judgment.



I think it=92ll be big challenge for you to do education the coming semeste=
r.
But meanwhile I think you=92ll have great fun doing it and find yourself
having learnt a lot at the end of subjects. Your unwillingness to have
group of people with you would perhaps change somehow then. But what do I
know. Everyone has their own ways of dealing with social encounters. So do
you. It=92s just personally speaking, I would say it perhaps is better you
become sociable and talkative when other people are around. In my opinion
we form as groups and society of man kind. And we all need other people to
get to know where our position is and to function as a social creature as
that=92s the way we are. But then again, this is only what I think. And you
perhaps have the better answer to it.



I hope you are having a great time there and with your family. I think it=
=92s
so nice you can read on your travelling. Reading on your journey is like
two parallel stories going on at the same time, and one might find it
distractive and burdensome. It=92s a precious quality you are able to read
and to devote yourself into written words at all time. That almost doubles
your travelling experience and reading will even make the actual travelling
more interesting and enjoyable.



I=92m going to bed. This is the second time I stay over in my old time dorm=
.
Everything is going well so far. And wish you an early Happy New Year.



Kisses & Misses
