Dear Lach,



It=92s certainly been the worst day yesterday since my coming back. I staye=
d
in bed all day and couldn=92t even move as my headache was giving me a hard
time keeping balance while standing. I couldn=92t sleep and couldn=92t eat.=
 But
today is looking up and after a few pills and some drug the pain went away
and the body temperature decreased. So now I=92m able to be typing to you
thank god.



Merry Christmas! It=92s such a nice day in the year and hope you=92ve done =
your
shopping properly. I=92d say it must be like what happens during Lunar New
Year here in China when people are all crazy shopping in malls and
supermarkets. I personally like it when I go to shop with lots of people.
It makes you feel less guilty about spending money on things you probably
wouldn=92t need seeing that others are doing the same thing if that makes
sense haha. Even we don=92t have Christmas as a festival in official accoun=
t,
but there are still people who go out and spend some quality time with
their loved ones in a restaurant or do something like that. Mostly among
young boyfriends and girlfriends. Unfortunately I don=92t have such a perso=
n
to do it with so I=92ll probably stay in and watch a few straight porns to
kill time ahaha.



It=92s funny what you said in last letter. Reading books about basic
knowledge is an interesting thing. I remember when I did the same thing in
high school I was fascinated by the facts introduced in books all the time
but a few days later those things just vanish from my brain and it became
empty again. First I thought I was stupid and couldn=92t even retain a dece=
nt
amount of knowledge in my head. But I then come to realise it=92s just how
our brains function. It=92s said almost 80 percent of population are not
satisfied with their ability to memorise and hope for a better one. How
greedy we humans are to always want something better, even it=92s our
memorising skills. But the scientific fact is that most of people don=92t
have much difference in their memory capacity. It=92s the techniques we use
that help us memorise and make our memory much organised, which appears to
seem like as if we=92ve got better memorising capacity.



I think to some extent reading science books is like reading joke stories
in terms of having fun reading and killing time. I don=92t think we can get
much more from reading this over reading that and all sorts of reading
should be appreciated as they can always help us in some perspective. This
is why I=92m turning less picky in reading these years. Some books even bri=
ng
about effect we cannot notice for years but still have a great impact in
our way to live. I remember reading the book All Quiet on the Western Front
when I was in junior high. Even though I=92ve almost forgotten all the
details of the story I=92d still say it=92s, not one of but, the best novel
I=92ve ever read and it has made a great shift in the way I write. The sort
of calm style in storytelling and how Remarque threw out the conversation
did impress me. It was even the start when I decided to spend more time in
reading book of western writers and novelists (but not poems by the way,
since it was Allen Ginsburg who first dragged my into reading poems).



I=92ve got some most interesting stories about a teenage boy loving to read
but always forbidden by parents and teachers. But those wouldn=92t be funny
stories at all to tell so I=92d only stop right now (lol).



It=92s Christmas Eve today and I miss you so much. I think I=92ll take the
penguin outside and hopefully we can have a great time. That way the pain
caused by being far away can to some extent be quenched. Hope you have the
best time with your family and hope you get the mostly wanted gifts.



Merry Christmas again.

Kisses & Misses
