Dear Professor Hutchinson,

I'm so sorry to bother you with this email. But I ran into a tech issue
with my computer while I was doing the first quiz and had just fixed it.
But the hour for completing it has already passed and I didn't even get to
do all questions apart from the first 4 or 5. I'm just wondering if there
was any way I could redo the quiz as I truly value the result of this
assessment.

Thank you for reading,
Aohan
