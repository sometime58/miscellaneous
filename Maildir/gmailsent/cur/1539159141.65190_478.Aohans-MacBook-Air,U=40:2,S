- Knock knock.
- Who's there?
- It's L.
- L who?
- L tell you where's your Valentine's surprise!

Hello Lachy,

As you know, I've stored in your room a little surprise for Valentine's.
Now I'm writing you to tell you where it is. You'll find it right under
your bed around where you usually put your feet. It's on the side close to
your window so you reach your hand in and you'll find it. It might get
covered with dust as it's been there for a while. But I wrapped it so it's
going to be fine. Hope this thing I prepared for you can lighten your day
after the horror strike (which I don't expect you come across if could) of
the newly started semester of teaching.

Happy Valentine's Day!
How I hope you can be with me right now so I can hug you and kiss you and
we'll cuddle in bed.

Be nice and happy. I'll be back soon.
The L word person
