Hey Marlon,

Hope everything's going well with you. About the bills. The gas and
Internet are okay. They are just taking time to process the change. The
power bill account is trickier tho. They say you have to talk to them in
person to cancel your account for our new account to be installed (they
didn't mention that last time). So you probably needed to call them
directly to cancel the account yourself. It'd be really helpful if you
could do that. I'll take it from there and look after the progress later.
If you couldn't, just let me know and I'll try to think something else.

Their local number is 13 3636 and the account number you gave me was
7549616.

Thanks.
Aohan
