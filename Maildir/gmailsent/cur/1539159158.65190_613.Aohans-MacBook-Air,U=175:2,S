Hi Maddie,

I'm so glad to hear from you. We welcome everyone who would like to join
us. Nora and I (my Chinese name is Aohan and I actually prefer people
calling me by it) are teaching the beginner stream, so we start from zero
and learn only the basics. I think this will be a good opportunity for
people to get to know about Mandarin without any previous studying. But we
certainly embrace people who have taken some form of education in the
language but still want to learn with us as well. Our class starts at 6.30
pm every Tuesday night. It's in room 104 in the law building (185 Pelham
Street, Carlton).

Nora will be giving our second class this week and we are doing the topic
on self-introduction and covering the basic expressions commonly used in
conversations. We will also revisit some of the content we talked about
last week and do some intonation practice to further equip our brains with
this important linguistic ingredient in Mandarin. I think our website will
be helpful as our class materials will be released there every week prior
to the class. I'll attach the address to the end of this mail.

We didn't cover much in the first class so you don't have to worry about
catching up. Also it's not necessary to print out the ppt slides. Taking
notes will be enough and I think people actually are better off doing it as
writing helps the memory. If you have any further queries, just shoot me an
email and I can direct you to more information. Really look forward to
seeing you in our class.

All the best,
Aohan Wang
