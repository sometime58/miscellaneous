Dear Mr. Wolfielambie,



I assume you=92ve had some of the greatest days with your family and in you=
r
comfortable seaside summer. We are like living in two separate worlds and
right now I=92m enjoying my days next to the heater with my sweater and thi=
ck
pants on. Isn=92t it amazing there are so many things going on the same tim=
e
we live and we would never know what they are like until we actually go and
take a look. It came to me all in a sudden yesterday that someday I=92d go =
to
south America and Europe and maybe the woods covered under snow somewhere
in Russia just to have the experience what it=92s like to live in other
places of different climate and views. I think travelling makes one realise
how great the nature is and how tiny we are compared to it. Yesterday when
we drove up north to the mountains close to where I live, when I face the
large surface of water frozen to ice and when the wind came to me from the
front, I thought I=92d never been more calm and peaceful than I was. I came
to think that we were all part of the nature by origin but yet we=92ve gone
so far away from it. there used to be a topic we did in philosophy tute
that whether animals have souls. And according to some theory from Kant (or
it=92s just somebody else and I remembered it wrong), they don=92t and
therefore they don=92t have emotions either, but we, as human beings, have
souls so that we can act freely in accordance to our will. Right now I
believe so unswervingly that that=92s not true. I think nature has spirits.
And maybe we are even just the small pieces of soul that finally come
together and form the whole of the nature. This might sound crazy but just
to think, if we can be built up by nucleus, then why can=92t we be the
element of the nature as a whole.



Thinking back, I used to have so many of my own philosophical theories of
the universe and how it=92s built. It=92s all the consequent result of what=
 I
was doing at the time. When I studied mathematics, I thought it should come
as the core of the universe. When I did logic, I thought it should rule all
processes of the whole space. And know it=92s the nature. If I=92m not care=
ful
enough, maybe someday I=92ll be on my way to godliness and talking about
unearthly souls all the time haha.



You were right in your letter. We do have preferences and always it=92s so
hard to get rid of it. but as teachers I think, one of the most important
thing is to avoid having preference upon students and don=92t let our emoti=
on
come in our way of judging them. I believe in the theory that kids are like
unstained papers. They learn and they get to know and they vary. There
shouldn=92t be some power endowed to learn in them before the birth or
whatsoever until they are told what is what. So we should treat them
carefully with patience. The boy I talked about, I think the problem there
was the parents didn=92t let him know what should always be the right thing
to do. People should always be polite and so forth. And also, he=92s not ev=
en
got the chance to know what it is he wants, due to the overprotection on
the part of their parents in his childhood, so now he worries and cares so
much about the material matters over anything else. Finding interest is
crucial. In some point, your interest defines who you are.



Well I haven=92t done much so I know feel I=92ve got nothing to tell you ab=
out.
life=92s become a bit boring lately and I=92m reading some books about anci=
ent
chinese medical just for fun. Apparently the philosophy of yin and yan,
along with so many other things, take up a huge part of medical treatment
in old times. It=92s like reading medical and philosophy at the same time.



It still hasn=92t snowed yet. Dry weather is killing me. Hope you take care
of yourself well.

Kisses & Misses
