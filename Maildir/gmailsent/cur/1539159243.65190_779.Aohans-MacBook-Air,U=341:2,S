Hi Mr. Garrett,

I'm sorry it just occurred to me that I didn't tell you about the time
change of my professional practice seminar. It was originally 8-10 am this
Friday but was moved to 8-10 am Thursday (today). So I won't be at school
until that is over.

Sorry for the late email. Hope everything is going well and look forward to
seeing you tomorrow.

Aohan
