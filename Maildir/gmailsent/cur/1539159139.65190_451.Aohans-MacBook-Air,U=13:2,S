My dearest Lach,



I'm sorry for Nathan's potentially moving out soon. Sometimes life is so
hard with some hard-to-deal-with kind of roommate. I hope the escalated
fight between Chris and Mari does not make you suffer too much and that you
can survive holding all the pieces of yours from some vocal combat
together. Isn=92t it amazing how people come to battery, both vocally and
physically, as a solution to the problem they have trouble with, and always
end up adding a mess making everything even worse. I remember Karen from my
favourate show Will & Grace (as you know) has the saying that goes like
this. =91There is one thing from ancient Chinese art of Taiqi that I learnt=
,
that if you do it in the morning, you end up wanting to do it later in the
evening=92. Oh wrong quote lol. It should be =91there is one thing I learnt
from the ancient Chinese art of Taiqi, which is that violence is always not
the answer=92. I think it applies to batteries of all sorts. Even violence =
by
something as simple as wordy insults can bring some huge painful emotional
sufferings to people who involve in the battery. And worst of all, quarrels
do change things between two. Once you quarrel with another, there is
something between you that you can never go back to. Not to mention
enduring some awkward moments when confronting each other again. But it=92s
always a paradox, cause if you don't express your anger, others will never
know something they do really bothers you. I think it=92s all about the way
you tell people how you feel. Chris assorts to some confrontation that I
don=92t prefer to use with my own trouble. But I do admire him and his
bravery, as I always think I would likely fight if I was good at it.



I think you were right on what you said in the last letter. While
tranquillity always leads to boredom, excitement always gets people
stressed. But for some reason we prefer stress over boredom. But just from
a second=92s thought, I will no doubt choose tranquillity over excitement
instead. There is one thing I appreciate the most, which is what I feel or
how I feel. Peacefulness is the sort of thing I=92d devote myself to had I
got the chance, seeing that no need is there keeping yourself occupied
unless it=92s a live or die scenario like having to work for food and place
to live. I see a lot of people working a dead end job and striving for a
life they may not so be enjoying as they expected to. But after all they
can always convince, or rather delude themselves that this is the life they
are going for, this is something they want. Funny enough, for most people
they can never reach their dreams, and lucky for them. But some who make it
will always find out there are things more important than what they thought
they wanted and it=92s always been something they once got at hand at the
beginning but easily abandoned on the way to their goals. Isn=92t it the
story those alleged successful people always tell? Isn=92t it sad? But for
some reason people keep doing it and throw themselves to this age old joke
of our lives over and over again like this needs proving anymore. Isn=92t i=
t
stupid? I, not willing to admit, may perhaps even be one of these people.



This is why I need philosophy, to see through these things and become
crystal clear about this stupid clich=E9. Philosophy makes you able to thin=
k
about possibilities of another direction of life while going the other way.
This is the help I need when life turns out to be some sort of a trickery
experience full of nonsense and deception. So when you said you can only
deem yourself as a good philosopher if you can make yourself less
frustrated in life using philosophy, I=92d think- to do philosophy is to
choose to frustrate. Once you get involved in the possibility, you are
doomed to be frustrated. And all human beings, even those who are said to
be great philosophers, can see not all consistent in their theories and
thoughts. So don=92t rush to put all things together. Just let the strands =
of
thought flow and go with it. I=92ve said this but I=92ve got to say it once
more. Life, is meaningless. We are trying to find something meaningful out
of meaninglessness, so there are certainly frustration and a lot of work to
do. So when you consider life, the way to go is not asking why, but asking
how.



I don't expect you can agree with me on this, seeing I used to be thinking
all about this kind of thing just the same during high school when I read
too much. At that time I was very emotional and when alone I=92d cry out of
no reason but to feel extremely overwhelmed and depressed. I think
philosophy does a lot to your sensation and makes you totally sensitive to
even the tiniest thing. And now I try to avoid it, not that I=92m willing t=
o,
but I have to for the sake of my own mental orderliness. See, I=92m doing t=
he
same thing that you said, avoiding pain out of my nature.



But I do hope you can cheer up and don't let thinking come into your way to
happiness, even the happiness that=92s meaningless. That=92s why I always
choose to smile even when I feel distressed or upset. Life is so damn hard
if we can=92t laugh through it. So we have to give ourselves some reason to
feel happy where nothing is worth being happy about. I don=92t mean this in=
 a
way that you are not happy now, I=92m just saying that thinking is a lot of
fun, and all the confusion and depression are just coming as a part of it.



So much about serious things. I went to my old uni again yesterday, hanging
out with friends and stayed overnight. Fortunately there was an available
bed but the quilts weren=92t so good and so was the pillow. Ahaha. This is
the first night out after my coming back and I don't wanna go back home
anymore. Dining with strangers is driving me furious and repellent, slowly
but gradually. I don=92t think I=92m strong in emotion and I can always sta=
y
cool. But this thing is ridiculous and getting really ugly. I just don=92t
understand why I have to embarrass myself competing with someone to get
hold of his more than half full cup or glass in his hand just to pour some
more tea or liquor into it while he is saying I don=92t need to and he can =
do
it himself like he=92s really sincere. And I don=92t get why it makes me po=
lite
and well-mannered. And today it seems that although nobody on the table
really wants to drink alcohol they still have drunk 3 bottles of them,
which by the way costs about 200 Aus dollars or 1300 Chinese Yuan. I mean
this can make a good donation to some people who are still striving to live
and now they are just wasting the money to some stupid drinking competition
that nobody likes. I hardly ate anything for dinner today, busy =91taking
care of everybody else on the table=92, filling a hundred cups and glasses,
spilt a few times while competing, which FYI is known as friendly and
polite. I tried mind wandering to decrease the pain but I couldn=92t. They
keep talking and asking and making some annoying remarks over and over and
over again and it was causing through me like poison. I just don=92t even
wanna believe this is gonna be the same story for all dinners on weekends
for at least the next two weeks.



I=92m in deep regret coming back. Only the good friend reunion, as it alway=
s
has been, highlights my day and makes me less upset. I=92m going back to my
high school next week and will see some teachers who helped me get through
those grey periods of my high school years. Hope they are still there.
Weather is getting pretty cold and I think I=92ll need a scarf very soon.
Environment is polluted as usual and I can even smell the fog in the air.
But this is Beijing, the place I love and hate at the same time.



Miss you. Be happy.



Greetings from 5,700 miles away.

Albert
