Hi Babe,=20

As I am typing down these lines, I=E2=80=99m still in the library, =
enjoying the quiet and peace after a day of hustle and rush. The =
headache is subsiding. I can feel my mind to be much clearer. The =
thoughts of you seem to have always been a reverberant theme of a mental =
symphony in my head. Every note echoes with the warmth of your touch, =
your gentle breath, as I still so vividly remember, enveloping me, =
reminding me of how good we had it, and are still having it.=20

Over the weekend, I=E2=80=99ve been lucky to have the time to indulge =
myself further in the grandeur of poetry. It has a healing power. John =
Keats always helps me find the cheerful rhymes of nature and lights up =
the colours in the world around me. Robert Frost then takes me through =
the most commonplace of life and regales me with the abundance of =
provocative meditation on what makes the mundane a marvel. Then I =
revisited Elizabeth Jennings and her Absence.  All of a sudden I was =
haunted. That =E2=80=98savage force=E2=80=99 made of your absence is, =
now, not only lashing me with the reminiscence of times we shared, but =
the thought of how things could=E2=80=99ve been much glorious had I your =
company in all times past. Babe, bittersweet, bittersweet indeed.=20

I=E2=80=99m fascinated by the power of sparkling thoughts that have been =
condensed into words by those foregone in history - how they still have =
this lasting beauty in the way of tucking on the heartstrings of people =
like me who live in such an immensely different time. Some things are =
due to wither, but others shine under the brewing care from a mother =
called Time. What a way to think of someone=E2=80=99s existence. All =
questions can so easily boil down to the part of you that is passed down =
generations to finally find a way to resurface through the resonance of =
another=E2=80=99s heart and soul. And this process, in and of itself, is =
so poetic.=20

Seasons are changing. Like the ocean, there is this season that=E2=80=99s =
separating us. But my heart always finds its way to sail through it to =
find where yours is. And you have my words. Though very soon they will =
weaken and fade and become forgotten, as they do. Underneath my chest =
there beats my heart so strongly in want of your company and your =
calling my name.=20

Yours,=20
