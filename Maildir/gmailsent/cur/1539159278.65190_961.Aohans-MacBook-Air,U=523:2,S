=E4=BD=A0=E5=A5=BD Alex,

Your reflection is wonderful. It's extensive and analytic. I also like that
you choose five characters that look so similar. That definitely adds up to
the difficulty of learning them.

Could I also ask you to get some feedback from your student as well, if you
can and they are not extremely busy=EF=BC=9F Listening to their experience =
can
maybe give more insights into teaching and learning and I'm sure both of
you will benefit from it.
