Dear Lach,



It=92s been nice hearing from you as always. I=92m so glad you=92ve enjoyed=
 time
and company with your family and helping with the housework. Honestly
speaking I=92m the type of guy who enjoys so much in parenting. You see, ki=
ds
are always changing throughout their development. And as a developmental
psychology student you=92ll find amazing how those shifts work and what the=
y
mean to become into a certain phase of life. So parenting means so much in
a child=92s life and is a great part of how their values are formed towards
things. And also, housekeeping skills is a big part of life. You have to
familiarise yourself with all aspects of what life can be like and be ready
for challenges always. Supply kids with all sorts of resources they need
can be a hard task. During almost all periods of a child=92s life, especial=
ly
the adolescence, what they need emotionally always will come first before
the physical requirements. Some psychologists even say that teaching is
conditioning, so all kinds of influence will certainly have impact upon the
modes of one=92s behaviour later in time.



By the way I=92ve finally pinned down my subjects two days ago. I=92ve been
going back and forth on which to decide between philosophy and media as I
want to do double majors. The result is I chose the latter. Apparently
cultural study is more interesting to be doing and also this way many
pieces of articles about people=92s behaviour will be involved in the cours=
e
whereas if choosing philosophy, all we will read will be great works from
well-known philosophers about pure strands of thoughts in their mind. But
after all I=92ll keep on reading philosophy. That way all the questions and
confusion in my head about life can in some way be responded to and
hopefully one day I can get over with.



I think I understand your uncle who moved to England for more than ten
years but still contains this attachment to the coastal scenery and the
land where he was originally born. Going overseas to me is no foreign
notion but still feels so unique. Change of place of living can totally
change the idea of a place from what you=92ve expected. There can be so man=
y
things out of your anticipation, whether good or bad, and you learn from
what you experience as well as the great gap between the imagination and
reality. Actually when I first got to Australia, I didn=92t expect much. I
think I even imagined for the worst coming up. You know, a guy in a new
country, different people, different views. And I really had a hard time
understanding the accent, by the way, still do. I still remember the first
time I came out of the room for security check and went to the counter for
where I can take a taxi as I don=92t know anything about the public transpo=
rt
routes, and the woman in the counter smiled really sweat to me but said
something that I almost was sure what was definitely another language, I
got stunned and, hate to admit but, rather petrified. I guess the first
impression of Australia to me didn=92t do its justice that at that moment I
was almost one hundred percent sure the at least next three years here
shall be miserable and lonely. Living in another country is so different
and it makes you learn a lot more than you=92ll ever expect. On this part I
may be able to sympathise with your uncle and therefore admire him for
doing that over a decade.



I hope going back to Melbourne can be real fun to you. What do you plan to
do before the teaching begins? Eating a lot of Mds? Bathing yourself in the
sea of philosophy? Writing small comments about anything you come across in
life? Hope you have the best return and enjoy your journey.



And also you are the first one I=92m telling you about this besides my
parents. I=92m so eager now to share this with you since your appreciation =
is
so much important to me. I=92ve won an award in a kind of a literature
writing contest! It=92s not even the first time me winning any prize in
writing but this time it=92s somehow different. This one is big and is alwa=
ys
the kind of award I=92m long for. It honours those who write seriously and
with great passion in literature as well as writing. It was the third race
I won so it wasn=92t that big as hell but great deal to me after all. I=92m
asked to give a speech as I=92m the youngest winner this year and I am
willing to do so. I=92m always not a fan of expressing my point of views in=
 a
public scene but this time I feel, stronger than ever, that I should stand
up to give a speech. I have to say something for those who are like me in
their 20s, young and enthusiastic, and still believe in writing, the kind
of difference one can make using their pens and paper in this day and age.
I want to, at least, represent a group of people who are still striving for
expression and compassion with their words in mind and skills in putting
them together. This is like the biggest achievement I=92ve ever made in
writing, and I appreciate it so much. I hope you can feel happy for me as
now talking about it, I can=92t even stop my typing fingers from shaking.



This is not the first time I talk about literature with you. Whenever it
comes to this topic I can=92t help getting depressed. I think modern
technologies and the fast style of life are stifling literature. the way of
communication nowadays is draining people of their creativity and
literature is dying slowly with the progress made in media and lessened
time spent in reading. The story I sent for contest was actually the story
I wrote when I was in high school but sent after some small adjustments. It
was about the story happened with me and a group of friends. We used to
form up a literature group and talk about writing and writers. There were
more than twenty of us from countries all over the globe. I got to meet one
of them when my family travelled to Spain to see my aunt living over there.
Penzi is the name of him, who later introduced me into the group and to one
who was the person in my story, Carl. Carl died in his 28, 22 May, 2010. I
wrote this story to commemorate him after I got the phone call from Penzi
that Carl had passed away in his apartment. He used drugs to keep him
working 24/7. He started this newspaper where he published things written
by himself as well as his friends.

I think we came together out of desperation and belief we all have upon
literature. the big dreams of ours and we thought we couldn't give it up
without a fight. After Carl=92s death, we kind of drifted apart with only
occasional and infrequent contact given that the core of this group is
absent forever.



Now I come to think about dreams. The greatest dreams one can ever have in
time of their lives which not only involve themselves but also people of
contemporary and the past. Those dreams are mostly long gone without people
mentioning them anymore, like literature, and so many things alike. I don=
=92t
even know now whether it=92s good or bad anymore. sometimes I just think wi=
th
deep regret, but somehow having to, that perhaps oblivion is the best
answer for most of the questions of this kind.



I=92m sorry if the content of my letter brings you down. I don=92t usually =
get
so serious with others like this. And by the way, this is how when I=92m
really serious is like haha. Always with a mood of depression and deep
confusion.



Hope everything is going well and always will be.

Missing you

Albert
