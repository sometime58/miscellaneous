Hello Sophie,

It's kind of you to write the letter and thank you for your information.
Hope you've had the best time as well. I'm sorry I just read your letter.
I'm still away from home to see some of my relatives so I'm afraid I can't
do the transfer right away. You see I still can't remember my client
number. But I promise I'll do it as soon as I get home and have a check on
my note. Sorry.

It's amazing how it's so hot in Melbourne but right now I'm living under
temperature of -10. Hope everything is going well with you, It's a bit late
to say Happy new year I guess. But wish you the best anyway :-)

Albert
