Hey Lach,

Your thoughtful insight of last letter gets me impressed and I have to say
you are such a great thinker in philosophy as you think accompanied with
your own experience and perception. You seem to know how to use your
sensation as a tool to think deep. That's a good quality I think as it
keeps your talk practical the beyond academic jargon.

The thought you brought up that the valued pairs of pursuit of people in
opposite groups make people on both sides think they are doing something
meaningful and therefore can be satisfied about what they are doing, is
interesting. Just to think, it seems that we always find our meaning of
existance in others like they are some sort of inspiration outside of us.
But logically I don't think the meaning of us humans should come this way
to us, because if the valued goals come in pairs then how had the first
goal come about as it has not yet got the other goal to oppose to. Of
course you can say they come the same time for goals from both sides. But
how to explain that we should all admit that once we take one side of view
we cannot take the other, in other words, the different opinions must come
from separate people. So the chance for coming up with opposite views on
one thing simultaneously, as it seems to me, doesn't exist. I would rather
think that our goal comes within us and we choose our goal as active
subjects acting out of our free will. Furthermore, i think it's not only us
humans that have goals. All living beings have goals the same way as long
as they can think. Although I've got no supporting evidence to prove it
true and I know this requires much of argument to either claim that there
are other beings with thinking capacity or to say we have such things
called freedom of will, but I think humans find their pursuits by
processing information and experience. They figure out what they like or
dislike and try to acquire things beneficial for them and get away from
those considered harmful. About the thing you called pain, or I'd call
suffering, this is more of the use of language than the actual negative
effect that is referred to in this scenario. What I mean is that pain or
suffering can not always be generalised among individuals. As I said, a
torment for one can be the same time joyful thing for another. So even we
both talk about suffering, we refer not to the same thing. Hitherto, can
not agree upon the fact that what we are inclined to do is to get away from
some suffering that is universally negative for all life beings. (Remember,
all we actually have regardless of humans' bias is fact) Moreover, even for
individuals, it's not always that one thing must be either this or that.
sometimes they can be in the middle, neutral and neither good nor bad. The
only way we judge a thing is based on our acquisition of sensational
enjoyment. At this point I agree with you that we know things through
sensation. So the pursuit of a more joyful sensation is what leads us to
choose our goal.

So as I think it, we are not avoiding suffering. What we do is just
fulfilling human's nature of chasing sensational joyfulness. Like if you
throw a ball it'll drop with gravity, if there comes a stimulation, we go
with our nature light and make our own choice. So the happiness we always
talk about, we just refer to it as fulfillment of sensation enjoyment. The
real happiness should be peacefulness, the fact of knowing that 'good
things' (things that bring about benefits) and 'bad things' (things that
oppress sensation) coexist, which leads to realising that bad things do not
necessarily bring depression just the same as that good things do not
always end up happiness.

If you let me to explain your worries, I'd say it's not that if you avoid a
thing, it just becomes worse. It's that when you are avoiding one polar,
you also abandon another polar, which in return makes it seem worse as the
goodness of that thing gets cancelled by your getting rid of the formal
polar.

I don't have much to say about temperament. I think it's like the mode you
turn to to make yourself more comfortable under your circumstance. It's the
same story fulfilling sensational needs. I personally like the temperament
(or say personality) of yours that's not so aggressive and trespassing. I
also think one should do as much as they can to avoid battery.

Thank you for your books again. They didn't turn out to be obligation but
real rejoicing for me. I'm still chipping away. As the story goes, our M.
Poirot gets more confused and I think he's really smart. I wish I could
have insightfulness as he does and always act calmly and with
determination. There aren't many things exciting in my life as usual, but I
did make a plan with friends going to Yunnan in January for about a week. I
don't really look forward to it seeing it'll be perhaps a long monotonous
trip with no things to see and to do over there, but after all I've got
quite a few days with friends and be able to escape away from the
depressing atmosphere of Beijing. I also started picking up some old habits
with some card games and badminton. It was very nice doing them again, like
all memories of old time just came back all in one second.

Unlike you, I like to put small, everyday things of this kind to the last
part of the letter. So now that you know, next time you can just skip the
end part of my email if you get so exhausted reading my dumb words that
don't make any sense at the beginning. Mostly things I'm gonna say at the
end are probably just how boring my life is and how much I miss you.

I feel I have thousand more words I wanna say but I'll stop right now. I
feel like every one more word I write down could add one more drop in my
bank of tears and will make me think even more about missing you. Hope the
sunny days of Melbourne treat you well, and remember that there is a guy
missing you so much in a faraway land who always wishes you happiness and
well.

Looking forward to your reply as usual.

Albert
