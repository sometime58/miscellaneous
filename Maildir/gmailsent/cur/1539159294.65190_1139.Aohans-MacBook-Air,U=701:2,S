Hi Michelle,=20

Thank you for your email. I am currently still on the look out for =
information on data analytics and data modelling courses on your website =
along with a few others. It would be great if I could email you later to =
organise a phone call when I will be coming to deciding whether to take =
a course, since I tend to get busy during business hours on week days. =
Thank you.=20
