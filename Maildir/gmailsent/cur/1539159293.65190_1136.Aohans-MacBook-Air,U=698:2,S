Hi William,=20

Hope everything is going so well with you. I told you I would write you =
letters. I guess this is the first one now. Many times I have started =
jotting down a few lines then scratched them. I just couldn=E2=80=99t =
seem to form a coherent thought, when my feelings for you only grew =
stronger ever since I left for Australia. I kept reminiscing about the =
night when I was about to head off for the airport. In your room, you =
held me so tight, and so did I you. I felt your breath brushing on my =
neck, kindling a longing that started from my skin and ran right through =
my veins to set off an avalanche of emotion in my already bedazzled =
head. I=E2=80=99m addicted to you - an addiction that is impossible to =
curb, for it goes way beyond the physical.=20

I still want to thank you, for helping me see what romance means from a =
different angle. Now I realise it that reckless emotion can be immature. =
Sometimes we just have to let things happen the way they are meant to, =
even though it might mean things don=E2=80=99t go our way. For so long I =
have been taking refuge in romance, allowing myself to indulge in =
emotion while trying to keep a level head with what life has to offer =
with other things. I was used to thinking that the rationality I tried =
to keep up should exempt me from having to be responsible for what I =
feel in an intimate relationship. But you were right. It was like a kid =
thinking that for every right thing he did he deserved something else in =
return. And this grow-up moment was painful. That=E2=80=99s why I cried =
so wholeheartedly the other day. Not because I thought wrong about it. =
Nor was I unwilling to learn this lesson. Growing up can hurt so bad =
sometimes. So when it is inevitable, embracing it takes both =
readjustment and healing.=20

Now I can take a closer look at my heart - what I want, what I fear, and =
what I expect. All of a sudden, things become different. So many =
impulsive things I would do in the blink of an eye before, I now feel =
uncertain about. Maybe this is a better way. Missing you from a distance =
and trying to make time to be together instead of asking for too much =
for the moment. If this is maturity, I=E2=80=99m happy to embrace it =
now. Because, and this is what I really want to tell you, all the things =
we=E2=80=99ve had and all the things I=E2=80=99m feeling about you are =
still standing so strong, and feeling so real to me that they make me =
want you, care about you and long for you all so much. So working =
against all odds that may seem a little frightening to me, I will always =
remember the faith I am feeling right now. And if things will change, as =
they always may, so be it. Slowly, all dots will eventually show me how =
they are connected. No promises, no certainty. And life is just so =
exciting because of it.=20

William, I miss you so much. Until the next time we get to see each =
other, I=E2=80=99ll keep missing you like this. But it also feels so =
beautiful to know that there=E2=80=99s someone far away that I know is =
missing me exactly as much as I am missing him. The distance is never =
the oceans and mountains that separate, but how close it feels when two =
hearts are missing each other. And right now, you are here with me.=20
