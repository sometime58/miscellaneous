Dear Mr. Justin Garrett,

This is Aohan Wang, the teacher candidate. We met earlier today.

It was so kind of you to let me observe your classes . I really liked the
way you delivered information and how clear you demonstrated key points and
concepts. It seemed like you have a great relationship with your students
and a great heart to teach them with love and respect.

I know you are really busy and I really appreciate that you spent so much
time with me, giving me some really useful advise and sharing some great
insights with me.

I'm doing a master's degree in teaching at Melbourne University as you may
have been told. My two teaching areas are Psychology and LOTE (Chinese). I
know the school doesn't run Chinese classes but I'm sure by observing
Japanese classes I will still be able to learn a great amount about
language acquisition. So far in my psychology training we have gone through
the main content on brain and its development. This part of knowledge is
covered in Unit 1 VCE psychology I believe. So I would be really glad if
there is anything I can help you with teaching, organising and material
preparing. As my academic study unfolds, hopefully I can do more to help
you with school work.

I really look forward to seeing you again tomorrow. Have a great evening.

Best regards,
Aohan
