Hi Mr. Garrett,

Hope you are having a wonderful week so far. I just finished my essay and
submitted it so now I can be fully concentrating on preparing for the class
this week.

Could you tell me which part of content on the textbook should I be
covering for the next class?
Thank you.

Best regards,
Aohan
