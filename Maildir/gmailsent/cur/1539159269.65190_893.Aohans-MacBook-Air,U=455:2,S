Dear Liz,

This is Aohan from Melbourne Uni Global Perspective subject. I'm so sorry
for emailing you so late. I would have done this last night weren't it for
my assignment due this Sunday I was working on.

It was an absolute pleasure to meet you yesterday and the class was
wonderful. It was thus far one of the only few moments I truly enjoyed in
this degree (although it's a real shame to say it :-( ). I've wanted to go
on your website for more information but haven't a chance to. I will
definitely do that over the weekend. Just want you to know that I admire
the great work your organisation has done and aspire to become someone
working for the same purpose and towards the same contribution to make in
the future. Hope we can keep in touch so that I can learn more from you,
your organisation and your dedication. It's truly inspiring to see people
like you working for education for the future.

Hope you've had a great day.
Best regards,
Aohan
