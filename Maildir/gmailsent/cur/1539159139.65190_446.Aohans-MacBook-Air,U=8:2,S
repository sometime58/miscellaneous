Hi Lach,



It was nice getting your email about complexity and simplicity. As I am
officially stunned right now by your deep thought, I find it hard to search
for some words in my mind to respond to that. Lucky for me to be here
writing now instead of having to talk face to face hah~. This leaves me
enough time to put my words together and form a decent reply without making
myself sound too dumb.



I=92ve been jumping between complex ideas and those simple ones for quite a
chunk of time. At first I thought it was always nice to think simple as
that=92s what most of ancient Chinese philosophers were talking about. The
idea of simplicity comes, I think, from Laozi, the person preceding
Zhuangzi and from whom most doctrines of Zhuangzi come. He thinks it is
dangerous to be thinking too much as philosophical thoughts bring about
confusion. The overloaded confusion finally will lead to hesitation and
freeze people from moving ahead. So the best way is either to stop from
doing or cut off the unnecessary thinking. It appears to him that the
answer should be the latter so he suggests people not to think and get away
from philosophy of all sorts. That being, people are freed from burden and
will be able to do whatever they want to. From a modern prospective, this
might sound insane. No one could do anything without thinking beforehand.
We are so wondered about cause-effect relation that we believe all results
can be traced back to a causal source- an incentive. But what if it=92s not=
?
What if all we perceive is only coincidence that repeats? I don=92t think
there is always a reason. Therefore, I don=92t think there will always be a=
n
answer. There are some other things needing our caring for- the drives,
things that push us forward and bring us back to real life from the virtual
reality in our head, like hunger, thirst, pursuit of happiness and
satisfaction. I would rather believe that we are driven by our sensations
and I apparently stand on Hume=92s side. This, I think, explains why I=92m =
not
so worried about =91the answer=92. I think humans are more like answer itse=
lf
and shouldn=92t be deemed as answer chasers.



About thinking, I am so amazed on how similar we are. I find it most of
time hard to think without words. The words, not only to help you think,
rather guide your thoughts, like the rope people hold tightly in hand when
mountain-climbing. So I sometimes just let those words come out like a gust
of wind and wait to see where it leads me to. It is funny that they come
sometimes in Chinese but in English in others. They even combine into one
sentence and make me confounded how weird they sound like. Every time like
that I feel like some kind of a ghost with no coherence within myself. You
are right it is two ways of seeing the world. But with an extra way comes
the torment of having to split your brain into two pieces. This is tearing
me apart, slowly but terribly. I can feel it. Sometimes I feel like I am a
psychopath. I don=92t know what to think and I don=92t know how.



I think there is no simple way to explain thinking. But we did talk about
how language advances human thinking in our psych lectures. It=92s said tha=
t
we invented language out of the need for explicit communication. We created
words with one-on-one relation to certain things. Then we formalised
sentence to make expression understandable and proper. As our need for
communication grew, the bigger vocabulary was needed. With the increase of
language using, our brain develops better capacity to deal with lingual
input. This is how our brain develops in terms of language. So you can see
how language and human=92s thinking capacity profit from the development of
each other. That=92s what I believe why nowadays humans can=92t think witho=
ut
language. I think sub-vocalisation is good as it=92s the sign of thinking
concentrated and in details. It helps you pin down the exact threads of
thought. Not many people do that anymore, thinking that=92s a waste of time=
,
which is why they always find flaws acting out of their incomplete
thinking.



I=92d better stop jibber-jabbering about thoughts and words and so on. But =
it
seems my last few days were total blank. Got nothing done, got no plans
what to do. Just walking around, hanging out with friends, chatting and
having some food. I=92m pretty slow on reading in both English and Chinese.
Haven=92t finished even one single book so far. But I=92ll stick to it. Hop=
e my
insincere effort could pay me off. I=92m starting off with one of the two o=
f
my favourite Chinese writers. He doesn't write novels much, but the stories
of his own life. He was once a huge poet in 1970s and 80s, brave and
passionate. But then he fled out of the country to Europe, then the US, due
to some political issues. Politics are always mystery to me. I don=92t know
how it can be justified to execute or punish someone just because they are
politically guilty or inferior. For writers of that age, being honest and
brave means taking high risks and putting almost all you=92ve got on stake,
your reputation, your family, your identity and sometimes your life. But
just to think, isn=92t it that that makes great people great and respectabl=
e
people respectable.



This Monday, I was introduced by my high school best friend to an adorable
gay guy who=92s best friend of another girl who is very close friend with
this friend of mine (I know it sounds so complicated). It=92s amazing how
social network works to bring people together. And one thing even more
fantastic is that we almost have the same kind of experience in school
years and we have many things we like in common. Now I=92m emotionally
supporting him to hang on with the relationship with his boyfriend in army,
because they are not able to see each other much and both of them are deep
closet cases. Though I think it=92s no good to say, but I really feel lucky
now about us seeing how hard the things are for them to go through. We=92ve
only got 3 months, but for them it=92s 2 years. I don=92t know why, but I
really wish they can make it. Probably because I have this sympathy and see
something familiar in their relationship. Just forget it. I=92ve no idea wh=
at
I=92m talking about.



It=92s 8 am in Melbourne right now. Wish my words can somehow make you feel
happy, or cheer you up a bit if you feel not so good (which I hope is not
the case). Good morning, or afternoon or evening whenever you are reading
this. And btw, when are you going to wagga? Waiting for your words soon.



Miss you.

Albert
