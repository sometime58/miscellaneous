Hi Lach,

It's nice you like the notebook(or at least not dislike it). Or maybe you
are just too kind to tell me it's such a bad gift. Whatever it is, I do
appreciate your being polite.

You don't have to write anything 'proper' as to me all your replies will be
equally appreciated and it's always so good for me hearing from you. I
guess right now you must be in sweet dream about going back to your family
and meeting up friends. And you must have got your bag packed readily. So
enjoy your time and your trip back and I'll pretend to be patient waiting
for your reply so don't be bothered too much and do whatever you can to
have fun in Wagga as it's so good having some quality time with loved ones.
No rush for reply and wish you an early Happy Christmas as it might be the
chance you don't have time to write anything during the festival period.

Also, kisses and misses.

Albert
