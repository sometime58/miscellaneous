Hi Mr. Garrett,

I think they look great. I took some time to do the questions and it took
me approximately 50 mins to finish. The one page with cortical divisions is
what I found the most challenging as the arrows do not indicate locations
specifically enough. But fortunately I managed to get them correct. Also on
the fore-mid-hind brain page with answers, the question box blocks part of
the hind brain box. But I think I know what to put in there so it's fine.

I have been thinking about my block placement and come up with more ideas
for the activities I want to do with the class. In the last email I talked
about the story-based activity but didn't elaborate in detail. Hopefully I
can send an email talking more about it in the next few days after I finish
the two essays due this week. If I can't, we can still discuss on it in
person later.

Hope everything is going well with you. I'd be really honoured if I could
do anything to help with the SAC preparation.

Best regards,
Aohan
