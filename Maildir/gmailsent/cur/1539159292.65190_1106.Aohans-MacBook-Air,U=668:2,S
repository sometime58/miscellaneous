Dear Officer,
I am currently overseas and sending the certified copies of the documents
above could be difficult and time-consuming. And I am not sure it they will
arrive by the deadline. Is it a compulsory requirement for the physical
copies to be sent to you? Or will a scanned version be also acceptable?
Hope to hear back from you soon.
Thank you for your time.
Aohan
