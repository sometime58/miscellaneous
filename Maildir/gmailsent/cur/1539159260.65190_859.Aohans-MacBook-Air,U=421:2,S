My flatmate is going overseas 22nd of July, which means our lovely
apartment is waiting for another kind and free-spirited person to move in.
It's at a great location on Arden Street North Melbourne. The Royal
Hospital is only around 10 minutes walk away and Melbourne Uni 15 mins.
Cheap rent (~$185/cwk or $804/cmth) + bills, perfect for UniMelb students
and professionals working in or around city. Tram 57 is 2 minutes from the
building, taking you all the way to the centre of city. Bus 602 also 2
minutes walk, going past UniMelb campus and royal exhibition building. The
place is in fine condition also.

It's a two bedroom apartment with a shared bathroom. The room you'll be
moving in has a built-in wardrobe and can easily fit a queen bed. The room
can come with all necessary furnishing, with a price open for negotiation
of course. Otherwise you can bring your own. Anything is welcome for sure
:-)

You'll be living with a 23 yo GAM (yeah that'll be me), a master student at
Melbourne Uni. I enjoy spending my time reading and learning new stuff,
always chanllenging myself intellectually and willing to have a
conversation between two pure minds (which sadly I found not quite a
quality as appreciated as I expected). Occasionally I'd lay my hair down
for a guys night out and indulge myself in some pub music induced limb
flailing (you won't call that dancing once you see me do it).

Non-smoker preferred. No gender preferences (although personally I want a
daughter :-D). Message, text (0404626535) or email me (
sometime5858@gmail.com) for further inquiries. Look forward to hearing from
you.
