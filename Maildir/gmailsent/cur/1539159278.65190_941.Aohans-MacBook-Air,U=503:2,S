=E4=BD=A0=E5=A5=BD James,

=E4=BD=A0=E6=84=9F=E8=A7=89=E5=A5=BD=E4=B8=80=E4=BA=9B=E4=BA=86=E5=90=97 (a=
re you feeling better)=EF=BC=9F We've all been missing you in class.

In the class on Monday, we had a =E6=B1=89=E5=AD=97=E8=80=83=E8=AF=95 (char=
acter test) on everyone's own
level. Dylan and Sweyn also did a briefing presentation on using cue cards
to help learn new vocabulary. We then spent some time to watch a Ted video
on memorising Chinese characters.

Here's the link:

Hope you can find it helpful with your own learning.

We also spent the rest of the class finishing the undone work in Lesson 1
(Translation of the dialogue on Student's Book p92&93; Workbook p66&67
exercises 1-5).

Today Daniel and Kanishka gave their briefing presentation on different
dialects spoken in China. We then played a treasure hunt game on vocabulary
for Lesson 2. Everyone was assigned two words from the vocab list on
student's book p93 to make sentences with as homework. We'll come back to
the sentences tomorrow.

Also there's a double period this Thursday. So another =E6=B1=89=E5=AD=97=
=E8=80=83=E8=AF=95.

Don't worry too much about the school work. Take a good rest. If you need
help with catching up, come find me when you come back and we'll work
through it. =E6=B3=A8=E6=84=8F=E8=BA=AB=E4=BD=93 (take care)=EF=BC=81

Best,
=E7=8E=8B=E8=80=81=E5=B8=88
