Hi Carlo,

=E4=BD=A0=E7=9A=84=E5=87=86=E5=A4=87=E5=A4=AA=E6=A3=92=E4=BA=86=EF=BC=81I'm=
 deeply impressed by your knowledge in grammar. It's nice to see
that you follow all grammar points with example sentences to illustrate
your points. Your fellow students will learn so much from your
presentation.

My only concern is the time it takes to go through all the content. How
much time do you need? I'm willing to give you more time as these patterns
and words are so important and useful in Chinese. Just email me if you need
any help on anything.

Keep up with the hard work and you'll be absolutely remarkable (=E6=9C=89=
=E5=BF=97=E8=80=85=EF=BC=8C=E4=BA=8B=E7=AB=9F=E6=88=90)!
