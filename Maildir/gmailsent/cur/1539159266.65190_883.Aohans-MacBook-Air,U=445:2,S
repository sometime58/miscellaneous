Yeah. It's quite easy. Remembering a few key words may be helpful tho.

Glaser - developmental level
Vygotsky - ZP(A)D
Rasch - 50/50

Also a few key terms-
Criterion referencing - indicative behaviours
Norm referencing - comparing with students of the same level
Standard - combination of both but more focus on the criterion ref

There's quite a few questions on identifying taxonomies and which level of
each taxonomy the texts refer to. Just have the textbook and you'll be fine.
