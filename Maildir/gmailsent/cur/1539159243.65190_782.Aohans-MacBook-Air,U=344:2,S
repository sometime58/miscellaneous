Hi Nicole,

This is Aohan Wang. Unfortunately I lost my bank card yesterday so I had to
freeze my account. I'll try to apply for a new card but I'm not sure how
long it'll take to get done. Since tomorrow is the time to pay rent can I
transfer the money directly to your bank account?

My address: A1-2 100 Arden Street, North Melbourne.

Thank you.
Aohan
