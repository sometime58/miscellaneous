=E4=BD=A0=E5=A5=BD Cameron,

We don't have any specify homework today. But I encourage you to use the
two revision sheets I handed out yesterday and the sample test paper on
google drive to help you prepare for the Unit Test coming up tomorrow.

May there be any questions or things you need help with, just email me and
let me know.
