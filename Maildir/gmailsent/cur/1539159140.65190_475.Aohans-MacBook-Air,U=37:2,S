Dear Lach,



It's been several days since I last wrote again. I've been running around
doing some drop-ins to my relatives'. It's tradition catching up with them
and we give gifts to each other- not the kind of gift I've got for you for
Valentines which will come in no less two weeks time yay- the kind of gifts
like some bottles of wine or huge boxes of drinks or food. I helped with
most of the carrying and delivery. It was exhausting. I'm got two more
houses to go to tomorrow. You never know how many relatives you have until
the lunar New Year comes. Lol



There was a huge firework taking place on New Year's Eve like all present
years. It was beautiful and lasted for an hour. But the aftermath was
terrible the next day when I woke - completely ashy and dusty the air was.
But considering how horrid the environment in Beijing already is, this
doesn't add up much to pollution. I like how we are so emotionally attached
to this festival. Family gets together and we talk for hours like no time
else in the year round. Talking about family getting together, I went with
my mom up north to meet my dad who was still on business. It's the first
time I ever stay overnight on new years eve somewhere other than my own
home. It's interesting, it's new, it feels exciting. It's boring, it's
terrible, it's unfamiliar and I didn't really like it. but experience
matters I guess. It's always good to try something new. Lol



The festive vibe is going to last for two weeks. Then it's lantern festival
symbolising the end of the new year period. That's the first big day after
chinese new year's eve in lunar calendar. There are some public parties in
some temples here in Beijing. Some traditional performances will be on
stage in outdoor. I'm planning to go to one with couple of friends. Hope
it's good.



About the books. I didn't say the book of Wodehouse was not good. Instead.
It's terrific. I get the idea of his somehow serious way of telling the
jokes (per say) with academic words apparently written by a well educated
scholarly professional writer, which gives his story a sarcastic reflection
on the characters and activities. It's just not my thing. And it was really
difficult for me to read him as I did it with the help of a dictionary all
the time. It's after reading him that I realise there are still so much I
have to improve in this language. How bad I am I wonder haha. Harry Porter
stirred up this mood of reflecting on memories from ages ago when the first
movie of this series came out. I used to wonder where I'd go if I was to be
examined by the sorting hat. Gryffindor is totally not my thing, as I'm not
so brave and passionate on things. But still I don't want to go to
Slytherin. It's hard to choose between Haffpaff and Ravenclaw as this whole
story seems to be themed with the other two. But it's not really a bother.
I won't get in at the first place anyway.



I've almost forgotten you are to be 24 this year. In china this is the
milestone year of your life and it's supposed to be special. Your closed
ones should buy you something red that'll bring you good luck. I'm
considering right now. what should I get you? I feel so excited as you are
the only one I know who's of the same zodiac animal as the year.



Talking about food, you seem to be pretty okay with my curry. (at least you
didn't throw up, that's all I care) so if you were to eat some chinese
dishes of mine some day, hope you don't feel terrified about the taste. I'm
not a good cook I'm telling you this just in case. So prepare yourself to
be amazed and horrified/haunted as it's probably going to have some ghostly
effect on you. I'm not kidding. I'm not.



I just came back from poker game in my aunt's with other cousins. It
reminds me of the time when we played card games. Playing poker is
certainly relaxing, especially with people your age. I find I'm so okay
with losing. Sometimes even the kindest people get upset and angry when
losing but I don't. I feel nothing but relaxed and, somehow, released.  We
can't win everything we want right? I won't go for some philosophical
sayings like 'life is like a poker' or anything, coz it's not that way.
id's say I know what to do to win and fulfil you sense of achievement, and
what to do to have fun. Playing gets you a lot of fun. And losing in a game
makes you feel even happy knowing that all you are losing is just a game.
We played until we all feel tired and ready to get some sleep. I walked the
way back and after I got home, drowsiness had all gone because of the cold
air outside. I feel that occasional nocturnal walks sometimes can be
soothing and refreshing. The air. The darkness. The light. It's perfect.



I haven't lit up any fireworks so far. I don't do that for a long time. As
stupid as I already am, I'm afraid I'll get myself caught on fire somehow.
It's very dangerous a thing for me to do stuff like this. Haha. I'm such a
coward.



Is everything all right in Melbourne? Hope the temperature can go down soon
and become cool before I go back. Take good care of yourself. A couple of
weeks left. I miss you.



Best festival wishes,

Alberto
