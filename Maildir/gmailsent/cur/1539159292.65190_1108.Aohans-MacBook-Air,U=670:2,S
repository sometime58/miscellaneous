Dear officer,
I have booked flights via you from Beijing to Melbourne and have just
received the booking confirmation (MF235534918). But here under "checked
baggage" it says there is "no baggage". Does that mean I cannot have a
checked baggage with me to check in? Because on your website after search,
the results showing up all include checked baggage.

Would really want to hear back from you soon.
Thank you
Aohan Wang
