Hello Lachy,



How=92s your trip to you grandpapa's. Finally departing =91Wargar=92 and he=
ading
somewhere else in the vacation eih~. I=92ve been planning our travel to
Yunnan now with my traveller team of four. It=92s heard it=92s still warm t=
here
but all sorts of dangerous little creatures like spiders and snakes. It
kind of creeps me out so I=92d stay in some better hotels so that we won=92=
t
find any surprises in our room=92s tub or under the bed. Yes you see it
right. We four are staying in one hotel room with two double beds. That=92s
the best we can get from our limited budget. But it won=92t be so much a
problem for me I guess. I=92ve been sharing my living conditions almost my
whole life throughout student years until recently. So this time, I'm
heading to the Mount Doom with courage and determination in two weeks=92 ti=
me
but I=92m sure there won=92t be any ring involved this time haha.



I don=92t know if you=92ve got the best kind of relationship a grandchild c=
ould
ever get with his grandpa. Personally I=92ve been sharing some best times
with mine when I was a child and when my parents were so busy with their
works and didn=92t have time to take care of me much. But coming to these
four or five years it=92s got down as he=92s getting a bit messed up in the
mental and always thinks that somebody would bring him away and kill him.
This brainiac condition is causing so much burden in his mind and know he=
=92s
become such a lunatic. Last time when I went to see him, which only takes
about 30 minutes on the way by the way, he could barely recognise me and
shouted as soon as he saw me =91you can take me away now, I=92ve already ha=
d my
lunch=92. I think this is from some piece of his memory when he was a young
elementary student. They got to go to school after their lunch at home
during noon break. Also it reminds me of last time when he called me upon
in private and said to me he=92d secretly stored coins of ten in his wallet
under bed and had told no one yet.



I always wonder what it=92ll be like after I get old, as old as my grandpa.
Look how amazing those distant, fragile pieces of memory can be recalled so
easily that they come vividly to you but disorderly and get you stuck in
fantasies. I=92ve no idea but just would guess that shouldn=92t feel that
great. But I=92ll probably be in that state now that I carry the gene in me=
.



Last two days has been the worst post-Christmas period in my life. I=92ve
been staying indoors and mostly on bed as the cold bounced back and hit me
right in my face. But I think now I=92m alright and all cured, but only fee=
l
no appetite at all. So I had some chocolate for lunch and they are so
great. It gives you enough energy but doesn=92t make you feel full and
stuffed in the stomach so it=92s the best thing after illness. I=92ll treat
myself with some good for dinner tonight as I=92d have to cook for both my
parents are out having some business dinner with their colleagues or
something. I enjoy having the whole place to my own and have some me time.



Wish you good time at your grandpa=92s and the coming trip to Port Macquari=
e.
I=92ll be here to miss you and to wish you the best and to be in charge of
holding the penguin tightly until next time we meet, as always.



Kisses & Misses
