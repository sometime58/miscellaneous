Hey y'all,

I've created and shared a folder for our assessment including the
spreadsheet we were working on and the template of this assessment from lms
with information I'm able to fill in at this stage. I hope it looks okay.
There is a 'topic of construct' that we have to write but I don't know what
it is. You guys got any idea?

Best,
Aoahn
