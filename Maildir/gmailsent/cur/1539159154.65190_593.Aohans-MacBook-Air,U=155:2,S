Hi Frans,

I'm not sure since we are having a new class coordinator next semester and I=
 still have not heard from him/her. I think it should still be the old time (=
6.30 wed nights) since it's been this way the past few semesters. I'll let y=
ou know if there's any change to the time the second I know for sure.=20

Have a good one!
Albert
