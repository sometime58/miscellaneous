Hi Justin,

Sorry I should've told you this earlier. I did this a while ago and forgot
a couple of nuances entailed.

The address is: A1-2 100 Arden Street
Suburb: North Melbourne
Commence Date: 18th July
Term: 6 months (This is the minimum lease period. After that it'll become
month-to-month till you wanna move out)
Rent/Mth: $804 (No need to break it into weeks)
Bond: $758
And there will be no other applicants to occupy the property as there is
only one person to move in while I'm staying put.

Thank you and apologies again for the trouble. We'll arrange the payment
with the agency next Monday. Have a good one.

Aohan
