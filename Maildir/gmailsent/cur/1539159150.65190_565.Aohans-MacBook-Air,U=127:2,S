Hi Esther,

Sorry for replying so late. It won't be late at all for you to jump on our b=
andwagon of studying Chinese at any time. So far students have familiarised t=
hemselves with intonations in Chinese, but this is a repeated theme of the c=
ourse and will be applied over and over so you'll get used to it by the end.=
 I'll be teaching today's class and we'll have a bit of review on previous w=
eeks so it's a really good time to join in and catch up with the progress. I=
f you have any questions coming up during the class, you are more than welco=
me to ask it anytime. Just come in and grab a seat. I won't bite lol.

Look forward to seeing you in our class today and hope you can have a good t=
ime.=20

Albert
