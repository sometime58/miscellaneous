Dear Dr. Margrain,

I strongly understand and sympathise with the struggling that Tim has to go
through. It would be my pleasure if I could help Tim with his school work
in any way possible.

Tim is a great student. From my experience of teaching and observation in
class, he has great potentials and can become a very high-achieving student
with help. His best characteristic as a student is that he has no problem
remaining focused on task. Therefore, the most important goal for his
studying is to find a way that helps him progress most efficiently and
assist him in making sense of textbook content.

As a student teacher and a Master's degree student in teaching, I
understand how big a responsibility it is to become Tim's tutor. So I would
be willing to dedicate my best effort and would offer help that both Tim
and you, as his parent, need as much as I can.

The only thing that matters the most is to help Tim improve and provide
him with strategies he can use. Therefore I need to get to know more about
him. It would be very helpful if we could arrange a meeting some time
soon so that we can have further discussion over his school work as well as
making plans that can best cater for his needs for learning. Furthermore, I
want to put the topic of payment aside for now and mainly focus on Tim's
studying. And also I have to spend some time to work with him so I can find
out what his real problem is and if I can help him with it. I propose we
can have a talk first and I work with him for a trial period. If both Tim
and you are satisfied with what I can offer, we can then talk more about
other arrangements.

The only problem might be that I don't drive so traveling might take some
time. Though I do think it's the best to do the tutoring at your place and
with family around since that's the safe environment and comfort zone for
him. We can talk more about it if we meet in person later.

Again, I really hope I can help him and that we can collaborate and do the
best thing that he needs the most. You can contact me at any time via email
or mobile (0404 626 535) and I really look forward to hearing back from you
soon.

Best regards,
Aohan1
