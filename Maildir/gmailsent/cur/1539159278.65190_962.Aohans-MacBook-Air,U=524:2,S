=E4=BD=A0=E5=A5=BD Thomas,

Your reflection is wonderful. It's nice to hear that your brother likes the
content you've chosen for him and, in particular, he's interested in his
zodiac sign.

Could I also ask you to get some feedback from your brother as well, if you
can and he's not extremely busy=EF=BC=9F Listening to his experience can ma=
ybe give
more insights into teaching and learning and I'm sure both of you will
benefit from it.
