Dear Nicole,

Sorry to bother you but the entire rent was taken from my roommate's
account last month instead of being split in halves and taken from the two
of us. Could you please help us have a check on what could have gone wrong?
Thank you.

We are residents from A12 100 Arden St, North Melbourne, Aohan Wang and
Justin Baggio.
Thank you.


Best,
Aohan
