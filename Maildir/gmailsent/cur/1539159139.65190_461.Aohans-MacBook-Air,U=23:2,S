Hello my little Lachy,



Sorry for not having replied you for the last few days. It=92s just there
were so many dramas going on recently that=92s causing me no time at hand t=
o
say anything decent and without a stable emotion to talk about anything, if
that makes sense to you. It seems that all the people I=92ve been meeting t=
he
past three days have so many dramas to share with others. And unfortunately
I was the guy they=92d share with. Every time when I found no things to tal=
k
I=92ll just nod my head and it felt so awkward. But I always think of mysel=
f
as a good listener. Sometimes I think what people need is just somebody
being there for them to talk to. They need to pour out their storied and
just by telling them they can feel better like some kind of release. So
when I=92m being with them, I try to ask questions like why and how those
things happened. This is like glue that holds their little pieces of mind
together and helps them continue the story telling. I guess that=92s why th=
ey
always want to talk to me, even sometimes online for hours, which, by the
way, is so annoying I feel.



It seems being a good friend is such a tough task. You have to train
yourself not to be so emotionally attached to every drama they tell,
otherwise it=92ll become too much to carry and finally get to you and make
you feel emotionally drained. I find talking to people makes you learn. It
says people learn from mistakes. But it doesn=92t have to be mistakes made =
by
your own right (lol). After long conversations, you begin to know how
others think different and you=92ll know next time what they really need to
get from your conversations and you just say what=92s needed to be said.
Talking to people, as you may understand, personally speaking is a mystery.
You feel that what they want to get from you is nothing but meaningless
comforting words and flattering praises. It doesn=92t even have to be
sincere, just nice to the ear and you=92ll be fine. I don=92t like it, as i=
t
doesn=92t really help with the situation they are dealing with. But what do=
 I
know. Maybe just being supporting is helpful enough most of time.



About the boy I mentioned last time, there are quite some things happened
after I talked but I=92d better not tell you much. I think he=92ll make a g=
ood
case study for an education subject. He=92s so typical and there are things=
 a
researcher can study from. The story of a spoiled child is never an over
dated material. Also this experience shows me how stereotype talking of gay
people having to be over sensitive about their look while straight ones
don't just doesn=92t work so well. He=92s such a self-conscious adolescent =
that
he wouldn't=92 even want to talk to people he doesn=92t think look nice. Th=
at=92s
so insane! I=92ve seen people who judge others just by the way they look an=
d
dress but after all if you ask they=92d say it=92s wrong doing that. But he
just seems no shame to admit it. not I=92m an expert in psychology, but  by
the way he talks about how uncomfortable he feels just talking to =91ugly
looking=92 people that he almost feels fainted just doesn=92t make any sens=
e at
all and I, if were asked, would say there is problem about his mental
state.



But just to think, if you look at it from a different angle, he=92s still
talking to me. So I guess I don=92t look so bad looking right haha. It=92s =
nice
you have chance to practice on piano during your trip. Don=92t say anything
like you are a loser. You are nice and talented and gentle and kind. I can
even imagine how wonderfully I would feel if I were there when you are
playing them your pieces. It=92s so joyful seeing you all concentrated and
submerged into the world of music. You are like an angel. Angel of Music
you are! J



Speaking of angel, how=92s your new haircut look (lol). Did you get tired o=
f
the old style and feel like changing into another one? I feel changing
hairstyle can make you feel as if you=92ve even changed your emotion and
attitude. It makes you refreshed in some way or another. So hope you feel
even happier than you already are. And also I forgot to ask, how=92s your
summer Christmas and New Year? Does being seaside really feel any different
from having a freezing cold new year. I bet you had some beer then of
course. The sea, the alcohol, and the golden sand beach, with family. Must
been a great time.



I think I=92m spoiled by the good weather in Melbourne. My cold has been on
and off for quite a while lately. Today I got up with my throat too painful
to speak anything. I=92ve never considered myself to be man with few words
but right now I am haha. And damn it doesn=92t feel any good at all. It=92s
strange i=92ve never been feeling so much worried about if you have taken
care of yourself good ever before than I am right now. perhaps it=92s just =
my
sick man mood. But do take good care. I had some bacon and mushrooms for
lunch today. It was good. Very giving you enjoyment of taste and power of
your body.



That concludes my letter now. I think I=92ll have to watch some gay themed
comedy to cheer me up later. Lol



Kisses & Misses
