Hey Lach

Sorry for the delayed reply. I've been running around these few days
meeting friends. Everything was just fine. You can never foresee how
amazing changes could happen to people and things. Those who were once
lofty and playful are now quiet and serious. And also how quickly they find
a girlfriend. To think, many things, even they may seem all the same, are
different from what it was in your memory. I don't know if change is good,
I just know it happens. All the time.

Actually I read your email on the subway yesterday, when I was on a ride to
my old university. While reading, the deep feeling of being far away from
you and being all alone by myself caught me all in a sudden that it almost
threw me to the edge of tears. Things you do as you always did, things you
think about that I'm dying to be by your side and hear you say. I can't
help picturing you walking alone, passing by crowds of people and blocks of
streets without me, which, as it always does, dragged me into smothering
desperation of missing you. This I felt so much. But now I have to put on
the mask of a tough guy, or I'm not gonna survive the coming three months.

The seriousness of your last email didn't shock me at all. In fact it was a
knowledgeable man who likes to think more and cares to be thinking that I
was reading. It caused me no angst but joy and inspiration from reading it.
Just as you said sometimes people get stuck into cycle of coming to a
solution then total cluelessness. I remember I used to be thinking all day
about the reason why I was being right where I was and what to do to make
that anxiety of existence subside when I was in high school during the time
I was hooked up with Chinese ancient philosophy of Zhuangzi. I suppose
you've heard of his story that he dreamed of becoming a butterfly and was
lost in complete confusion of what reality is. At the end he asked that
famous question, was it that he was dreaming of a butterfly or that a
butterfly was dreaming of him. This is kind of like what Descartes was
trying say in his First Meditation on first philosophy only 1800 years
earlier. At the end, he says that people should go with the flow of life
and the light of nature and stop making effort in changing what already is.
It always is that those who think more get more depressed from thinking and
the eternal solution that Zhuangzi gave was to stop thinking and, even
further, stop doing. I don't want to be lost and all confused but my
inquiring nature keeps me thinking and always leads me back to the vicious
trap of wondering what and why. So finally I found my own solution,
probably not a good one, but after all sufficiently working well. When you
think, don't get emotionally involved. You always have to go away and
continue on with your life after some kind of philosophical meditation. So
try to lock those agitating thoughts in a box when you need them no more.
But don't give up quality of seriousness because that, as far as I'm
concerned, is the only thing that makes your eyes bright when flood of
darkness comes and makes each breath of your aspiration as a human
meaningful. I remember the conversation I shared with one dear friend in my
high school. We were talking about rightness and wrongness that day and we
both agreed that there's no righteousness for the universe but only matters
of fact. The alleged right or wrong, like labels, is just the name people
give to things they see or hear of based on their understanding and what
they need. So something right for one is much likely to be wrong for
another. But we still need moral codes and ethics. That's what tells us
apart from the non-thinkings. So once you are born as a human, you by
nature put the responsibility of seriousness on your shoulder. And by
giving that up, you lose part of your humanity. I have to say that this is
just what I think and hope it doesn't scare you as I'm right now talking
like any other person but me lol.

My apologies that I always put on my strict face when talking about things
like philosophy and literature, which, by the way, is the reason I don't do
that often. But I find it particularly helpful to find someone to talk
about it. During discussion and reciprocal asking and answering, the
anxiety submerges and some things can become clear. I'm more than willing
to share any strand of thought at any time and you know I am.

There hasn't been much going on with my life back here in China so far
besides going to places to meet with friends of old time. Yesterday when I
got home at 9 pm and I walked into my room, I looked at those books on my
shelf and realised how long ago it was when I was reading them. So I
decided to dive into Chinese literature again as I did during those gloomy
high school days even though there are like 300 books already on my shelf.
Rereading is like looking into the mirror, you can always find reflection
of some details you've never come to notice before. But of course, I'll
finish those three you gave me at the same time. I've only finished about a
third of Five Lttl Pigs with most of the reading done on buses or subways.
This is how slow I am. I hope I can finish it by the end of this week.

I miss you. I've never regarded myself as a cold-hearted person as you do
(lol), but however, I find it hard to express affection by words the same
way. You are right, it's always the willingness to be with each other that
counts, and right now you can't even imagine how desperate I am to fly
through the next three months and go back to your side. I miss you.  I miss
the card games, the pasta, the massage. The smell of your hair, the taste
of your lips. Each goodbye and hello like they all happened yesterday. 3 pm
now, time for a nap. And wish you an early sweet dream when I am now dying
for your reply. But don't rush, I'll survive, at least I have to until I
meet you next time.

Albert
