Dear Nicole,

This is Aohan here. I'm the current tenant of the apartment A1-2 100 Arden
Street. We have found a prospect tenant Justin willing to take over the
lease from Marlon so I'm sending you this email to confirm what our next
step needs to be. I know there are two forms (one for lease and one for
tenant transfer) to fill out. But I think it's still better for me to check
with you as to how to fill in some of the blanks.

The address is: A1-2 100 Arden Street
Suburb: North Melbourne
Commence Date: 18th July
Term: 6 months
Rent/Mth: $804
Bond: $758
And there will be no other applicants to occupy the property as there is
only one person to move in while I'm staying put.

Is everything above correct?
Thank you for your time.

Best regards,
Aohan
