Hello little Lachy,



It=92s incredible hearing you say you are now living in Wagga with
temperature above 30, cauz here in Beijing it has lately gone down under
minus 10 only yesterday. Funny thing it still hasn=92t snowed yet but I lik=
e
it already. It don't know where this attachment to cold weather comes from
but when standing in the winter=92s strong, freezing wind, I feel like for
one moment I can stop worrying anything and just be gone with it with and
let me be blown to somewhere faraway.



I=92ve almost gone through the whole book the Five Little Pigs but I haven=
=92t
been reading anything in English the past few days. I=92m not gonna spoil
your fun reading by telling you what happens next but I do remember after
going through the first 6 chapters I have taken a guess of that woman Greer
to be the murderer, for all mystery criminal books are about people
committing crimes yet looking totally innocent and without motives. That
woman seems to fit in all criteria of committing a homicide, beautiful,
attractive, with no motives whatsoever and dangerously young when the crime
took place. And one more thing, I just get this feeling about those home
wreckers, not that they are evil, but dangerous, very to the edge of doing
things to make something even worse kind of feeling.



Just so I=92m thinking, I saw my niece last Saturday. She=92s only 10 month=
s
old now and looks so pretty and innocent and in peace. She=92s like a littl=
e
angel and it almost hurts me to think that someday this beauty of nature is
going to grow up and be bothered and petrified the same way by something
that=92s making us suffer right now. But after a while I come to release. I
begin to think that life is so unpredictable and that=92s the fun part. You
can=92t expect to have fun if there weren=92t gloomy bad times. It=92s alwa=
ys the
worse things that make better things better and together the goodness and
the badness conjoin and make our life a whole like the coin with two sides.
So as she grows, she=92ll go through her own ups and downs and throughout
this whole thing she=92ll find out what she loves and appreciates the most
like everybody else. So it=92s her thing to say whether her life is happy o=
r
sad, exciting or exhausting, satisfactory or petrifying. And as for us, as
her family and the elder, the only thing we should do is to be there to
support her through the hard times and to be happy for her when the moment
of achievement comes and that's all. So in this way, I don=92t think I=92m
pessimistic. My fear is strong, but so is my determination. And also this
is something I would like to share with others, that our life is not what
we think it is, it=92s what we hope it=92s going to be. So even sometimes w=
e
are so desperate and think that that shall be all and all should just stop
as what it is, there are always something giving us hope and making all of
our struggling and striving for life meaningful. You said you wish one day
become less pessimistic, and I think you will, because all of the crap I=92=
ve
been putting up with right now, I=92ll always know it=92s not the end of th=
e
world and one day when I look back to it, I can laugh and cry.



These are things that come to me by incident. Hope it can help you get
happier when you are getting through pessimism. But I know that pessimism
cannot stop by words, and I don=92t see the point having to get over with i=
t
anytime soon, as it=92s just phase of our life, like happiness or gramma=92=
s
time in room with air conditioning back in Wagga haha. So go with it and
enjoy each moment of confusion and doubting.



Speaking of confusion, I=92m still on my cruise to find my belief and I jus=
t
can=92t come up with anything other than blankness and meaninglessness. I
think as normal people we are so weak. We have neither power nor money to
do what we think should be done by those who have the money but got no
heart to do. And we have to admit that life is unfair. And it should be,
which makes us appreciate what we=92ve got even more. You said in your last
letter that you care about your life much more than you do for others. That
makes sense but to me a lot more mysterious and less as straightforward a
notion for me to figure out. I=92m always inclined to consider myself as
living in the network of this human society. So I think I should care about
people somewhere else in the world I haven=92t yet known and perhaps will
never be knowing. What gets me confused is that I start to see it pointless
worrying about others since whatever I think about others would never make
a difference to what=92s going on. The world is still the same dump even if
you hope it for a better place and that=92s really depressing. Those big
dreams of mine being super rich and helping people in need should only rest
in fairy tale fantasies of my childhood and that=92s what I see from this
world. So whenever it comes to this, I have to hold myself really hard so
that I wouldn=92t get mad and yell out to those who are telling me what I
should do and what I should believe in. But I think now it=92s time for me =
to
get pass all of these, knowing that nothing I do could help this damn world
become a caring, peaceful place where starving people can get something to
eat and evil politicians can stop brainwashing their people for their own
good.



I think I should stop right here rattling and fuming about my
disappointment. After all life is wonderful. I was bit down and blue last
time when I was writing, but I=92m sure things weren=92t that bad as what I
said they were. There have been a few quarrels with my mom but that=92s all
the way of showing her love and care so I can deal with it. Christmas is
coming. I guess you must be having a good time. Your little penguin is fine
with me here so you don=92t need to worryJ. I=92m holding him to sleep ever=
yday
so I=92m sure he=92s cosy and warm enough. Whenever I miss you I=92ll hold =
him
tighter, hope it doesn=92t get him uncomfortable lol.



I=92m recently hooked up with ancient Chinese literature. Again! Not only t=
he
stuff known to almost every white man like Confucius, which by the way is,
as far as I think of it, the worst part of our literature. I remember you
talked about Yijing, that book about some mythical things of life and
destination. It actually comes from Laozi=92s idea of Yin and Yang and is
mixed with some other theories of certain modes of nature, which is what
I=92m now reading about. That=92s really cool, isn=92t it.



It=92s almost a month passed but it feels like three months long already. I=
=92m
suffering from the slowly passing time but then again I=92ll survive. I mis=
s
you. And hope everything treats you well.



Kindly and patiently waiting for your reply.



Xs & Os

Albert
