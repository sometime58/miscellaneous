Hi James,

This is Albert. I am thinking of doing a hard news report on our Chinese
class for one of my media subjects. To do that, I have to find some people
involved in the classes to do interviews with. Would you have some time to
do an interview with me? It will take approximately 30 minutes to finish.

Thanks.
Albert
