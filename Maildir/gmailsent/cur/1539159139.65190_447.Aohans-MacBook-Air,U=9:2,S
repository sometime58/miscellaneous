Hey Grahama, how=92s your nap! LOL



Yesterday had seen me starting the endless marathon of picking up some
table manner with family and friends (of my parents whom I=92ve no idea the=
y
are). It was even worse than a nightmare having to smile through the whole
meal and pour tea for everyone on the table (again and again) and say
something you never wanna say to people you never wanna talk to anytime
later. Can there be anything worse?



Yes, when you have to listen to them speaking some insincere words back and
asking you stupid questions like have you found a girlfriend, or, do you
prefer white girls or Chinese ones. There was a moment when I was almost
about to give in and yell at them that I DON=92T GIVE A SHIT TO GIRLS AT AL=
L!
I=92M HERE, I=92M QUEER, TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT. But I finally caved in
considering the damage it=92s gonna cause to my parents. You know how thing=
s
are usually like with Chinese people. They never stop prying and they have
special interest in rumours. So I have to behave as if I=92m someone else,
someone so perfect as a son, a student and a man. It=92s somehow my
responsibility to be gentle mannered, nice and kind and sociable. Amen I=92=
ve
been doing that for almost 21 years and now I just get used to it.



Just so you know I don=92t particularly hate being with family and friends,
as long as I know them well and we get along. But being obliged to hang out
with people you don=92t know is just stupid, even if they are friends of yo=
ur
parents. So I got into some kind of a battery with my mom about this
yesterday. It=92s like reading history of Second World War of Germany. You
know it=92s gonna lose it, but there is some kind of fascination just to go
through it and wonder if they could win. But as I am so not good at arguing
with people, it didn=92t do me anything good but some silent awkward moment
with my mom during the day, which makes me never wanna do that again. I
really want to be a good son, and hurting her feeling is the last thing I
wanna do.

Anyways enough about me. Sorry for being so complaint. It=92s just that I=
=92ve
been down today. So just forget about it. It=92s great getting your email,
telling that everything is fine with you. It=92s amazing that just hearing
you do fine in your life can totally cheer me up and make me forget about
some annoying things that happen in mine. Thx for the offer of invitation
into your French studying group. I=92ve so glad to be your student. Where
else in world can I find another French teacher this adorable and I=92m mor=
e
willing to learn from. Perhaps we can try talking in French as well, as it
should be a lot fun seeing that it=92s second language for both of us. By t=
he
way I don't think you look anything like a German guy. I don=92t even know
what a German should look like. Should they have enormously large noses? Or
perhaps weird looking eyes? LOL just kidding.



I so miss you playing piano to me. Even that Mountain song sounded so
wonderful when you were playing. And by the way I just came to think, after
all of these times you talk about Mari and her scales, I actually haven=92t
heard her play any of them at all. Hope it didn=92t make you suffer that
much. Anyways, glad to know you are playing piano again. Feel free to
record some pieces and send to me if it=92s not too much of a burden. It
probably will be, considering your deficiency of knowledge in technology
haha.



There has been a growing query these days after rereading the Chinese
writer, formally known as a poet, who I was talking about last time. Is
there any point writing poems nowadays? Just like painting, poem is a dying
art. It=92s now slowly decaying within itself, witnessing many of the poets
turning into writing articles or plays. I, personally speaking, think it
shouldn=92t die out. There is something about poem that is so unique from a=
ny
other kind of writings, which makes it necessary to be saved from
distinction. I even have this special attachment to poem writing after last
5 years of practice. But all of these seem to be not mattering anymore.
Nobody knows about poem and nobody cares about it. Those heroes once lived
in China=92s history of poem are gradually forgotten and washed away. Like
painting being slowly replaced by photograph and other image technologies,
I=92m afraid that one day poems will be replaced by magazine articles and
facebook statuses. And one day, finally, the thing once carried all my
dreams of literature will fade away with no one even caring about. Human=92=
s
hand for writing is deteriorating, along with the withering of the brain of
creativity. The fast pace of the world is stifling literature until one day
nobody can ever remember a name of a writer, or perhaps there won=92t be
writers anymore. it feels so depressing and just thinking of this
possibility is taking me down emotionally. I don=92t know if it is still
right, or to say proper, to still carry a dream of one day becoming a
writer. Possibly not I guess.



It seems the sky of my inner world is just as grey as it is for Beijing=92s
the last few days. Just like you said, right now I feel no way back to a
lively emotional state and cannot imagine myself being happy while I=92m
right now down and blue. But things will get better, as they always will.
That guy I talked about in last email who I was being emotional support
for, is now kind of draining me. LOL. Like what your friends do to you, he
is killing my patience talking to him with the same drama going on over and
over. It=92s like there are two sounds in my head, one screaming I=92m bore=
d to
death hearing his drama, but the other one suggesting that I do want to
help him get through this because they seem so right for each other. God
knows if I was anything like him when I=92m disturbed by some earthly kind =
of
annoyances. But I know he really needs someone to talk to and I can imagine
what kind of a torment he is right now going through so I shouldn=92t back
out and watch him suffer without doing anything to help.



Sorry again. I don=92t mean to bother you with my live drama. I promise I
won=92t be like this anymore. The time is passing like a million year old
tortoise. I=92m still counting the day in tears but fortunately I=92ve got
quite a few things as distraction.



You said you=92ve already got the surprise. It actually surprised me how fa=
st
you find my first present for you. Even after you=92d told no to give you
anything, I still wanted to. So I implanted 3 gifts in your house in 3
different places. The labels are the first one. The second one is also for
Christmas and new year but it isn=92t in your room so you probably wouldn=
=92t
be able to find it. This is why I was asking when you plan to go back to
Wagga in last letter. I wanna tell you where that is before you head back
so that I can make sure it doesn't pass the time it should be given. But
right now I want to keep it as a secret. It=92s really just little somethin=
g,
and I do hope it be worth waiting for. I think when it comes to the gift,
it=92s what meanings it carries that matters. So I chose the labels just to
wish you to have a good time exchanging gifts with your loved ones as it=92=
s
supposed to be the highlight moment of a year. And furthermore, from a
selfish perspective, I wish that every time when you are giving away a
gift, the little label could remind you of a person thousands of miles away
from you in distance but right beside you is his heart. I miss you. And the
little penguin misses you too.



Tell me in the letter before you move back to wagga. And have a good day.
And be happy. I=92ll be here waiting patiently for your reply. Good morning=
,
and afternoon, and evening, and every single moment.



Albert
