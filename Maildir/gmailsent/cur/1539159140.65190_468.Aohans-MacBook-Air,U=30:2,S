My dearest Lach,



I'm sorry. It=92s been seven days since I last wrote to you. I=92m on my tr=
avel
here in Yunnan already. It=92s been surely a refreshing and eyes opening
experience. I=92m having trouble getting asleep first coming to a new place=
.
It=92s 5:30 in the morning but I=92m still up.



I surely do miss the massages. And the smell of the massage oil as well.
And layers of the blankets and sheets. And the card games. And Summer
Hights High. Basically everything. And when time comes to the point like
right now, when I=92m the only one awake, typing on my laptop, there=92s
nothing I can think of but you.



About the things that bother you in your life you wrote in the last letter,
I think they are all so common in everybody=92s life. We all have our
weakness. I think there is a part of me that I don=92t like about myself as
well. But after all, I love myself more than I hate it. sometimes I even
think only I, myself, can be the only admirer of my own. You see, what I
like is what most people don=92t dig into, and I lead such a dull life
spending most of my time wandering around and thinking about nothing. So
I=92m so jealous when you say you can get people=92s admiration just playin=
g
piano in front of them. Because it=92s so nice you=92ve got at least one tr=
ick
you are so good at playing while I=92ve got nothing. I always think self
admiration is not so enough for me. It seems I=92ve always been seeking
others=92 praise and approval but ending up failing all the time. Maybe
because I didn=92t get enough of it from my childhood. I played by myself a=
nd
my parents were so busy and didn=92t have time and attention to pay to me. =
I
don=92t think this is healthy either having great pathological need for a f=
ew
good words from others. But sometimes I just can=92t help it. obviously you
are doing this better than I am on being satisfied with what you=92ve got a=
nd
not so much caring about what other people say.



I think you are very talented in music, as I=92ve probably said for more th=
an
a hundred times. You play piano like an angel. So I really hope you get
more chance playing in the public so that more people can appreciate it
like I do. And also you should try to write some songs of your own. A
musician and a music producer is always what I wanted to be if I were as
gifted as you are. Music is like a remedy. It doesn=92t have to be quick an=
d
effective and powerful, but whenever the melody is on, the healing has
begun. It=92s great how you mind can relate music we hear with memory we ha=
ve
gone through. Sometimes just by echoing a certain tune the memory can be
traced back vividly as if it just happened not a long while before. this is
why when trapped in some certain moods, I=92ve always got some songs to
listen to. I=92d like to be your first listener whenever you finish a song.
It shall be the song singing about your own life and the story you feel
most interesting.



About the reward, it was something to commemorate a famous Taiwanese female
writer, who is, I may consider, one of the best writers of chinese
literature since 1970 or maybe even the modern history after the revolution
of chinese language. Basically there aren=92t criteria but some loose rules
that the articles sent should obey. It should be either about a person or
an event, or both. Then it should be serious. That=92s all. It really upset
me a little when I told two of my aunts about the reward and the 2000
Chinese Yuan prize from it and they all went like oh right, that=92s good o=
f
you. I felt strongly that my desire for compliment was so not fulfilled
haha. But who cares about some stupid words coming from a 21 year old guy
who don=92t have any hobbies but running a pen on a notebook about some sam=
e
all stupid verses or paragraphs. Maybe I=92m just too young for any big
surprize. Maybe.



I=92d tell you about my trip here but I=92ll save it till next time, when I
have been to couple of more places and tried more recipes of local cuisine.
Haha.



Hope everything is going wonderful.

Miss you so much

Albert
