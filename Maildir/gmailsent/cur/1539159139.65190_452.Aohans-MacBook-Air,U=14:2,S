Hey Lachy,



Sorry for your unhappy encounter with Mari. But I have to say to some
extent I kind of foresaw this happening, when all of that note story
started. It=92s good you don't get too upset. Time for that lady to learn h=
ow
to behave like a human being.



It=92s funny how I always encourage people to tell others how they feel, bu=
t
when it comes to me, it=92s just a whole other story. But deep down I do
think expressing one=92s feeling is a crucial thing in communication. I don=
=92t
know. Maybe it=92s just my afraid of arguing that=92s drawing me back.



I=92m getting through the huge crisis of getting along with my parents. The
fascination of reunion is quickly worn out and life has gone back to what
it used to be, me avoiding relatives and my mom arguing with me all the
time. I=92m never been in regret deeper than this right now. Why did I come
back? It feels like I=92m on a sinking boat and those people I=92m dealing =
with
are sharks lurking under the surface of water, with teeth sharper than the
fork and eyes brighter than the flame of hell.



I have been thinking about this unwillingness of meeting people. I think I
would perhaps like them if it didn=92t come as a compulsory task meeting
them. It=92s always the case we go against what=92s put right on us, or may=
be
it=92s just me in my raking back adolescent period of rebellion once more.
Adolescence. Damn! I=92m turning 21 in two days and I=92m still thinking an=
d
talking like if I was only 12.



Thank you for your happy birthday, which kindly reminds me of the miserable
fact that I=92m turning one year older. Looking back to the past year, I
haven=92t done anything that=92s worth talking about when I grow into my 60=
s
and am so weak that lying on bed telling stories of my lifetime is the only
thing I can do then. Yesterday I found back those poems I wrote during my
18 to 20 year old time. I read through them, seeing a man turning from an
ambitious dreamer full of passion and courage and youth into someone
discrete and pathetic. Those dreams I once carried with me have already
lost and buried in the dust now. When I read, all I can hear is a voice
drained of the juice of creativity and a tone that is so cold and
emotionless that I could hardly believe it=92s mine. I almost forgot when I
was 18, I read newspapers everyday worrying about the war of Libya and
territory issues between Russia and Japan. I was so concerned about people
suffering from famine and homelessness somewhere the other hemisphere. But
now I=92m so unsympathetic that I don=92t even bother turning on tv getting=
 to
know some pieces of local news. I=92m trapped in my own world and my own
emotion. The link between me and the outside world is breaking and it
worries me. I can=92t help wondering, is it what it takes to grow older? Is
it something we=92re all gonna lose as years pass by? Is it that finally
we=92re all turning into some cruel, ignoring people who don=92t give it a =
shit
to anything else but our own life? Only thinking about this is killing me.



On the turning of my 21 year old, but I=92m still trying to regain my faith=
.
What do I believe in? I ask myself. But there=92s no answering. It=92s too
quiet and empty in my heart that I almost think this answer isn=92t within
me. To find it, I have to continue cruising and exploring. But I=92m too
tired to cruise. I=92m once more a pure body without a soul or a spirit,
something that can support me through the dark and the hopeless. Now I can
be easily lost and deprived without even striving a single fighting
breathe. This thing now buries me and I=92m not able to get rid of it.



Alone with my dream goes my creativity of poem. I have picked up my pencil
like thousands of times but cannot even write down a single word. It=92s ti=
me
for me to stop thinking. I think I have to take a break not thinking about
anything and just go with the flow, to where my life leads me. 21 is not
bad, since I still got time to figure out and to adjust. I should perhaps
just stop sitting in front of my desk failing my temptation to put down my
thoughts in verses and go outside and have fun. I don=92t know. I=92m in
confusion.



I hope the gloom of my letter doesn=92t bring you down. Anyways it=92s
birthday! It=92s supposed to be time to harvest presents! Even thought for =
me
it=92s always not the case. We laugh, we cry and we grow. A new day has com=
e!



I guess that should be the end of my letter=85



Or not! Of course. How can I forget your Christmas present! Now walk (I use
this word loosely, you may as well run/rush) out of your room, search on
those shelves in your hallway, behind those books on the first level of the
right most shelf, you=92ll find it. It=92s really just a teensy little thin=
g.
Wish every single dream you write down could finally come true. I=92m sorry=
 I
should=92ve got a better one for you, but they are either too expensive or
too loudly sissy. J



Bad news is the third one is for Valentine=92s Day. So you still have to wa=
it
till then. But it=92s pretty easy to find. You=92ll probably get it. Haha. =
Not
like the first two, the third one is wrapped so it may turn out a bit more
serious this time. Be patient. Time flies.



Now the dawn is breaking here. I think I have to go to bed. Good morning to
you. And good night to me.



 Kisses and misses.

Albert
