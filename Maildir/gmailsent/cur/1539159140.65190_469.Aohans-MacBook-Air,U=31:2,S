Good day/evening Lach,



It=92s good to hear you=92ve kept all the things you do well organised. Liv=
ing
a regular life surely makes one feel chilled and peaceful in mood. I can
imagine how wonderful the music you played in the restaurant. How much I
hope right now that I was there. It=92s always nice you can do something yo=
u
love without hoping for getting any benefit from it. that means you truly
love it that even if there aren=92t any monetary things as the result of yo=
u
effort, you still enjoy what you are doing. But as a matter of fact we all
get payback from things we like to do- happiness, considered to me the most
important thing among all in one=92s life time. (by the way, hope the treat
of the restaurant was good haha)



Yunnan is definitely a place far away. We took plane here arriving at
Lijiang, and then an hour of bus ride to where we live. I=92m here with onl=
y
other two since one guy cancelled due to some family business. The scenery
is totally different from that in Beijing of course. Less people and less
traffic for sure. We live in a hotel in a small town. The decoration here
looks like really ancient and old fashioned, but meanwhile this whole place
has been completely commercialised. No one really lives in here. They open
shops and restaurants and hotels all over the place. So there aren=92t many
things to see and also not the way I imagined before we came. We=92ve tried
quite a few local dishes, some of which are really spicy. I mean, really
really spicy. some people may travel by their eyes, or ears. I=92d say I
travel by my tongue. Whenever I go to a place, I go straight to the
restaurants and order as much as I can eat. The taste of food is so unique
and lively and it retains the memory to your mind for a long while. And
next time when you throw food down to your throat all those memories will
come back and you can trace back the story of =91I remember when=85=92 But =
you
can see how funny it is that Mds and pizza huts are even more popular than
most of the chinese restaurants here to young people. It seems the whole
country has been westernised not only areas like Beijing and Shanghai. But
what can I say, even during yesterday when we were walking along the street
looking for a place to go, we saw this KFC and we went in for lunch. I have
to say that was the most fantastic lunch among four we had in Yunnan.



People drink a lot alcohol. it says all men here have to do seven things in
their lifetime according to the tradition- cigarette, alcohol, string
instruments, chess, handwriting, drawing and tea. But after the past few
decades, most of those are gone except the first two. That=92s horrendous.
Lucky for me I wasn=92t born here.



It just rained yesterday, while it was even above 0 degree outside. The
snow came down and melted immediately. It was beautiful and odd at the same
time. It=92s been the worst exercise I=92ve been doing here walking all day=
 and
not able to fall asleep. Right now I=92m exhausted but still there are many
more places to go. I=92ll probably not make it and choose to stay in my roo=
m
tomorrow sleeping all day. Hope I can gain my strength back soon.



But after all I find travelling inspiring. It feels like there are so many
things you don=92t know about until you finally reach there. People talk in=
 a
complete different accent and we=92ve got a huge problem understanding. Thi=
s
is also reciprocal. When talking to locals, none of us could fully
understand each other. So guessing and slow repetitions did most of the
work here. They also have a new language spoken by people of certain
background. The pronounce is different, and so is its writing system. The
sentence structure is completely different so no literally one to one
translation. What=92s interesting is their character. It=92s like drawing.
There is a character for working and it=92s just a man waving something lik=
e
a flag in his hand. Two parallel curves form the word road. It=92s like
drawing a road that zigzags. Many things of this sort.



We are heading to Dali by train tomorrow- it=92s like another suburb where
travellers go (as a matter of fact we don=92t have such a notion as suburb =
in
chinese). I hope I can get up early as the train leaves at 8 am. So good
night and sweet dreams (as you may have already been in it).



Miss you

Al
