Howdy Little Lachy,



This is me writing to you at my aunt=92s. Yes I=92m staying overnight here
today, and perhaps the next two days. It=92s always wonderful time to stay
here. Aunt and uncle are kind people and they are good to me. And better
thing is that I can finally get away from my social life with other
relatives, which means no more annoying family dinners and insincere
conversations. I=92m going to meet my cousin tomorrow. He=92s working alrea=
dy
in a online-game company. I like talking with such a person who=92s got
insight into his field and does good in his career. It makes me learn what
it=92s like to live as a professional and always he=92s got his stories tha=
t=92ll
stir up my curiosity and interests.



Last time in your letter you talked about pessimism pushing us forward and
giving us strength. I have to say in a lot of scenarios it is the case. We
suffer and we learn and we do better at a later time. But I still believe
in optimism, as if you say pessimistic thoughts gain oneself strength, then
optimism brings about strength to others. It=92s like butterfly effect that
sometimes one tiny piece of optimistic thought can be huge inspiration and
courage to someone else who=92s enduring some melancholic mood. It=92s amaz=
ing
how people can get happy only seeing others in a good mental state. Like
flu this positive attitude passes over among people and provide them with
hope that better things will be encountered some time in the future only if
you hang in there and get through the occasional getting downs. So in this
sense I just want to say that being positive and being negative on you
outlook are just two different mental state transferrable from one to
another and they all have their pros and cons. The way we see it matters
more than how they really work to us.



And personally speaking, I always wish to myself that I can be happy all
the time even for the wrong reasons or absolutely no reasons at all, cauz I
find happiness cause no negative effect on people. The seeming happiness
that ends up in tragedy is just tragedy in disguise. It makes you mistaken
excitement and sensational rejoicing for true happiness and makes you
pursue those that will make you suffer pains. The only thing able to save
you from pain is a happy attitude. So I spent quite a chunk of my time in
high school and uni to learn how to laugh through my pains. How I can look
at the bright side of things that are already upsetting or disturbing. Then
I find out that being happy doesn=92t need a reason. At least it doesn=92t
always have to have a good reason. When good times come, you go with your
emotion and enjoy it. When bad things occur, you feel lucky that you=92ve g=
ot
plenty of time to live and what=92s now bothering you will certainly all ge=
t
past. This does help make pains less painful a thing to go through. And in
this sense I wish you happiness, one thing that I appreciate the most no
matter what, because if you can=92t feel happy to yourself, then this
meaningless life we are living will be absolute hell for all of us.



I will go on to other topics before you are bored of my repetitively styled
old man talk that doesn=92t make any good sense. But I haven=92t got much o=
f
experience I can talk to you without boiling up my anger against some
obnoxious encounters. I=92ve been thinking about success and being successf=
ul
the recent couple of days ever since the ugly conversation I had with
another of my uncles. It started to go down when he open the box of his
advice for my future career. Or maybe even earlier the time when he
mentioned that I made a bad choice deciding to choose psychology as my
major. He then began to tell be that I SHOULD learn commerce and then
DEFINITELY HAVE TO go work in a bank or something RIGHT AFTER my
graduation. This is what he called THE RIGHT DIRECTION to go and will
finally bring about success. His words came to me so strong that I first
went stunned out of my words and then go straight to anger that I raised my
pitch of voice even a little bit. (Btw I think for one second I got the
same kind of shaking all over me as you did during the encounter with Mari)
I even proved to him what he said was logically wrong that no one can ever
know what=92s the =91right way to go=92 and what will finally lead one to s=
uccess
but he denied it at once accusing me of bringing up some theoretical logic
nonsense that I learn from my useless logic learning in university. It was
both harsh and embarrassing and I=92m sure it=92s gonna go on my top ten li=
st
of memories that I will never wanna look back. But what he said got me
thinking about the definition of success. I think being a successful
businessman is not equivalent of being successful in you life generally.
But people seem to have mistaken the two all the time. that=92s why when on=
e
tells a successful life story they talk about Steve Jobs and his Apple
company. Business success should not be regarded as success itself. It=92s
only a type of success, perhaps even the most superficial one, while there
are millions of other ways to say one lives a successful life. I retrieve
the memory when I had this conversation with my cousin who=92s dad of the
niece of mine I mentioned the last letter about education. He thinks the
reason why we go through education is not to make a whole lot of money
after getting out of schools, but, after all things we experience during
student ages, to become a person who=92s no racist, biased, and with clear
mind and the query to ask what=92s true and just, thethings modern people
have lost belief in. This caught me at once and impressed me so much. I=92d
say I=92d be even devastated after what my uncle said if I hadn=92t heard m=
y
cousin like this. But now I find my faith not shaken by any of my uncle=92s
words at all. And I do think that if there really were a right direction to
go, this should be it.



Faith. It=92s to support us through hard times and after all of these years
and the shifts that ever happened to my faith, I still think that we need
it. So now I=92m still on my way to finding out the answer to the seemingly
unending query, what=92s my faith. I know it=92ll take time but I=92ll neve=
r
quite cruising.



I talked with Thomas yesterday. Actually it was pretty much early this
morning. He=92s been in and out of a few relationships the past few weeks a=
nd
it=92s nice seeing he=92s not too upset about it. He=92s getting along with=
 his
life and I may add how genius an artist he is. He=92s never learnt about
drawing but meanwhile has done a pretty good work in sketching. And I=92m s=
o
glad he can put his emotion in to drawing and let pictures tell the little
stories in his mind. Looks like everybody has his own way to express
himself. Some write, some draw, and some play the piano (lol). I miss you
so much. Talking to Thomas even makes me miss you more and this feeling is
so overwhelming that I=92m almost on the edge of tears. Right now I=92m sta=
ring
at the penguin and him staring at me and I start to talk to him as if you
could hear me talking and know how much I=92ve been thinking about you. Wai=
t
for me there. Time is passing by.



Kisses & Misses

Alberto
