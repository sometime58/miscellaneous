Hello Lach,



Good luck with the coming semester in a week's time. Hope the teaching
experience doesn't make you that nervous. I always look good into you. You
are nice and gentle to people, and that's the kind of quality that makes
you a good teacher. I think when it comes to teaching, what's most
important is to encourage. Try to let your students find themselves what
they really like to do. You can never overestimate the ability of people to
learn what they feel most interested in.



I haven't done any exercise at all during the vacation. It's unhealthy and
slowly it's taking its toll. I feel lazy easily and don't feel like doing
anything at all now. I'm planning to change that. But it's really hard to
move your body when you feel lazy. Today I was to go outside and walk to
the supermarket to by some food. But after noticing a few potatoes in the
fridge I decided not to do that and cooked potatoes instead. I think living
in an apartment is back in this case. Having to walk downstairs is
certainly making going outside a hard thing to do.



I'll be put on the road again in two days' time with a couple of more
friends to Shanxi this time. I really don't want to go but my mother
encouraged me to do so. She's paying for my trip so what've I got to say
no. packing up some clothes and I'm ready to go. The reason why I'm not so
excited about this trip is I still want to finish some books before I go
back to Melbourne and start my year two. Going on trip puts all my reading
plan off and unfortunately it seems I'm not going to make it. but traveling
with high school best friends is so tempting and I can't defy the
gratification so at last I yield (sounds rather reluctant lol) and decided
to go with them. I don't expect too much about this trip. Good thing is all
group members are guys so one less thing to depress me during the journey.



To be honest I find travelling terrifying. New place. New people. New
things you never have heard about. I find myself uncomfortable situated in
something I'm not familiar with. Especially when what they say you can't
understand knowing they are talking in exactly the same language as you but
in a completely different dialect and accent.



I'm tired right now. I've got so oversensitive lately and can't go to
sleep. Festival gets me all agitated and uneasy to calm down. I'm on a very
irregular diet and all sorts of pain over my body. Cold for the third time.
The same thing happens this time every year.



I'll stop the letter for now and go have a bit of rest. Weather is so dry.
It's estimated it won't snow this year in Beijing.  What a terrible thing.
The only thing that could possibly cleanse the air pollution and now they
are telling it won't happen. L



Hope everything is going well. Miss you.

L
