Dear Jo,

Sorry for bothering you with this email. I am one of the student teachers
in your seminar. I've just got two questions regarding my placement.

1. Do we have to keep a documented record from our mentor teachers
observing our lessons? An if so, is there a template for that? Or they can
just do it in their preferred way?

2. I am currently teaching two y11 psychology classes and they are doing
the same topic each week, so my lesson plans for them will be quite
similar. Does that count as teaching two classes (90mins + 90mins) or only
one (90mins) when calculating the total teaching hours?

Thank you for reading.

Best regards,
Aohan
