Dear Jeasa,

Thank you for your email. I got in contact with the hosting website and =
had it all sorted out myself. It turned out that the code I purchased =
was with a another agency offering the same course from a different =
website. Therefore I had to redeem the code with BlueMountain.com =
<http://bluemountain.com/> instead of vizualcoaching.com =
<http://vizualcoaching.com/>.=20

Thank you.
Aohan
