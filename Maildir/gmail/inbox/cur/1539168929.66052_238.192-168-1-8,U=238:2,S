Dear Albert,

SAIL Maidstone has had a wonderful start to 2015, we would like to congratulate all students and their wonderful tutors on all of their hard work so far at SAIL, it has been a privilege to watch everyone being so studious on Saturday mornings! 

This Saturday the 28th of March we are having our first tutor training. This training is run by Child Wise on the topic of child protection, called "Speak Up". 

This will take place from 12.30-2.30pm, at the Sunshine campus auditorium, the address is:

The Visy Cares Hub, 80B Harvester Rd, Sunshine.

It is important that all volunteers attend this training. Please let us know if you are not attending. However, for those of you who attended this training last year you are welcome to attend as a refresher but it is not necessary to attend this again. 

An announcement that the kitchen at the Maidstone Community Centre will be renovated over the next few months. We will still be serving lunch by sending our kitchen volunteers to prepare food at SAIL Sunshine and bringing it back to Maidstone to eat. Please remember to bring your own water bottle to SAIL from this week. 

Just a quick reminder that SAIL starts at 10am for all volunteers who are not driving families. 

In exciting news, on Monday the 30th of March and Tuesday the 31st, some Maidstone Secondary students (years 10 to 12) will be participating in the WholeSAIL excursion to Parliament, the law chambers and the courts! This will be a very exciting educational opportunity. 

Please also check our new calendar that shows what is happening at SAIL Maidstone this year. Lots of very exciting events and activities are scheduled in! It can be found here:

We hope this helps you to plan for the upcoming Xtend cycles after SAIL and the tutor training sessions. Remember to keep an eye out for events that are added to this calendar throughout the year as they are confirmed. We would also love to hear your feedback about the calendar! 

Thank you again for your hard work so far this year, we are very grateful for all of your efforts! 

Smooth SAILing,
Nyssa Watson, Carlo Manley, Malang Deng, Yoshi Inada-Lane and Alex Heath
