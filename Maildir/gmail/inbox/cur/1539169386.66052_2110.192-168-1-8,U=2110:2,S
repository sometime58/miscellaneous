Dear Mr AOHAN WANG, 

You recently cancelled your Debit MasterCard ***** **** **** 2706. 

You'll get your replacement card within seven business days. If not, call us on 13 2221. 

What does this mean? 

- Since you reported your card lost or stolen, it's protected from unauthorised transactions.
 - If you think there's already been an unauthorised transaction, call us immediately on 13 2221 (call +61 2 9999 3283 if you're overseas).
 - If you have a joint cardholder, their card's not affected and they can continue to use it.
  

When you get your new card
  

- Your new card has a different number, so if you have regular payments (like direct debits) set up, they'll no longer work. You can update these payments when it arrives.
 - Your cancelled card's now removed from NetBank and the CommBank app. Your new card will appear when you activate it.
 - Your cancelled card's transaction history is still available and, if you've cancelled a credit card, you can still see that card's statements online. 

We can help

 - Get answers and share knowledge
 
 Yours sincerely,
 CommBank 

 

 

 

Yours sincerely,
