Hi everyone,

For this week's classes, please take a survey of how many law students are
in your class. This is very important as it may determine whether or not we
get sponsorship this year.

After class, please email me the total number of people who attended and
the total number of law students.

Also, please bring the attendance sheets to class again so that people who
missed the first class can put their names on the list.

Cheers,

Adam
