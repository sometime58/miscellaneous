Hey Han,

Absolutely!

We offer two courses at General Assembly when it comes to training in Data.
Data Science (part time or Immersive) and Data Analytics (part time or
online)

It would be great to find out a bit more about your background and
experience so I can help point you in the right direction. Our courses
cater to a variety of skill levels.

Data Science is more technical and involves some prerequisite programming
experience (ideally with Python). It is more about predictive modelling and
things like machine learning. Our Full time Immersive program
<https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-immersive> is really
geared for people who are looking to transition into a new career in Data
as we provide job outcomes support with the course to help grads break into
the industry after the course. The part time program is more for
upskilling.

Data Analytics is more about working with large data sets to clean,
structure and analyse using Excel, SQL and Tableau. This part time course
<https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-analytics> is more about analysing
data to inform better business decisions.

The best way to find out which might suit best would be to speak with one
of our Admissions staff who can help guide you through the options - let me
know if you would like to set something up?

Best Regards,
Michelle Ang
Admissions Producer
General Assembly
