Hi mysterious L=2C
=20
I'm in my grandparents' garage. I'm sleeping in it with three other people.=
 My grandparents aren't super mobile so they're living in this quite small =
place=2C which is optimal. The only problem is that when there are seven pe=
ople needing accommodation - it can get a little cramped!
I didn't bring my laptop as they don't have wireless internet so I'm on my =
nanna's computer. Needless to say that with all the interruptions=2C my mes=
sages won't be super long!
=20
It's really weird as in Melbourne I'm either by myself or with one other fr=
iend. Lately=2C I've been bombarded with countless group scenarios and it's=
 been quite a struggle to say the least. I've always hated them and probabl=
y always will. I find it hard to speak in front of people=2C regardless of =
how many. Who knows how I'll get through the teaching!
I've probably spoken in a similar vein before=2C but the past few years=2C =
especially the one where I haven't worked=2C have been really cruisy. Espec=
ially living with friends and people I get on with.
Now I go back to a house where one person despises me and where I'll be try=
ing to discipline a group of adolescents. I feel it's going to change my ch=
aracter if it doesn't break me. It's a pity - I'd love not to enter the rea=
l world and keep my relaxed approach to things=2C but I feel this can only =
crush me in the real world=2C which I've already experienced!
=20
It sounds like your trip will be pretty cosy yourself! Speaking of middle e=
arth related things=2C Cam and I went to see the second Hobbit movie tonigh=
t. It was pretty good - I'm starting to appreciate action movies more. The =
first one grossed over a billion dollars!
=20
I've been bingeing on chocolate today myself. Mum raves about it too - says=
 it gets it through her work when she starts to get tired towards the end o=
f her working day. Glad to hear you're on the mend and hope that you get yo=
ur appetite back soon - for non-chocolate things haha.
=20
I'm feeling super tired=2C as I'm such a weaky haha=2C so I'm just going to=
 go crash now. Hopefully my next message won't be so pathetic!
=20
All the best=2C

=0A=
How=92s=0A=
your trip to you grandpapa's. Finally departing =91Wargar=92 and heading so=
mewhere=0A=
else in the vacation eih~. I=92ve been planning our travel to Yunnan now wi=
th my=0A=
traveller team of four. It=92s heard it=92s still warm there but all sorts =
of=0A=
dangerous little creatures like spiders and snakes. It kind of creeps me ou=
t so=0A=
I=92d stay in some better hotels so that we won=92t find any surprises in o=
ur room=92s=0A=
tub or under the bed. Yes you see it right. We four are staying in one hote=
l=0A=
room with two double beds. That=92s the best we can get from our limited bu=
dget. But=0A=
it won=92t be so much a problem for me I guess. I=92ve been sharing my livi=
ng=0A=
conditions almost my whole life throughout student years until recently. So=
 this time=2C I'm heading to the Mount Doom with courage and determination =
in two weeks=92 time but I=92m sure there won=92t be=0A=
any ring involved this time haha. =0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
I=0A=
don=92t know if you=92ve got the best kind of relationship a grandchild cou=
ld ever=0A=
get with his grandpa. Personally I=92ve been sharing some best times with m=
ine=0A=
when I was a child and when my parents were so busy with their works and di=
dn=92t=0A=
have time to take care of me much. But coming to these four or five years i=
t=92s=0A=
got down as he=92s getting a bit messed up in the mental and always thinks =
that=0A=
somebody would bring him away and kill him. This brainiac condition is caus=
ing=0A=
so much burden in his mind and know he=92s become such a lunatic. Last time=
 when I=0A=
went to see him=2C which only takes about 30 minutes on the way by the way=
=2C he=0A=
could barely recognise me and shouted as soon as he saw me =91you can take =
me=0A=
away now=2C I=92ve already had my lunch=92. I think this is from some piece=
 of his=0A=
memory when he was a young elementary student. They got to go to school aft=
er=0A=
their lunch at home during noon break. Also it reminds me of last time when=
 he=0A=
called me upon in private and said to me he=92d secretly stored coins of te=
n in=0A=
his wallet under bed and had told no one yet. =0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
I=0A=
always wonder what it=92ll be like after I get old=2C as old as my grandpa.=
 Look how=0A=
amazing those distant=2C fragile pieces of memory can be recalled so easily=
 that they=0A=
come vividly to you but disorderly and get you stuck in fantasies. I=92ve n=
o idea=0A=
but just would guess that shouldn=92t feel that great. But I=92ll probably =
be in=0A=
that state now that I carry the gene in me. =0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
Last=0A=
two days has been the worst post-Christmas period in my life. I=92ve been s=
taying=0A=
indoors and mostly on bed as the cold bounced back and hit me right in my f=
ace.=0A=
But I think now I=92m alright and all cured=2C but only feel no appetite at=
 all. So=0A=
I had some chocolate for lunch and they are so great. It gives you enough=
=0A=
energy but doesn=92t make you feel full and stuffed in the stomach so it=92=
s the=0A=
best thing after illness. I=92ll treat myself with some good for dinner ton=
ight=0A=
as I=92d have to cook for both my parents are out having some business dinn=

with their colleagues or something. I enjoy having the whole place to my ow=

=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
Wish=0A=
you good time at your grandpa=92s and the coming trip to Port Macquarie. I=
=92ll be here to miss you and to wish you=0A=
