And here I find myself, trying to express my feelings, or I would choose be=
tter to say a way to let out what it is exploding in my chest. I am sorry f=
or this late reply, but as I just told you, I feel my language, my English =
and my patience is not enough to make a proper and a decent answer to such =
as beautiful words you send me.

Feelings, thoughts and emotions, all of them coexist in this small body tha=
t is used to express them through the eyes, if you can see my eyes you will=
 be able to understand but you and me (we) are paying a price to life for t=
he hurry of making decisions without consulting with our hearts, and now th=
ey are the ones who are requesting for answers, exactly like a baby pigeon =
cries to his parents for food and warm, my heart is claiming for what belon=
gs to him.

From the very first moment I saw you, that spring night waiting for me; my =
body shuddered in emotion and excitement, only knowing that probably you wo=
uld be upset for my not most beloved tradition of being late, but as they s=
ay: good things come to those who wait (las cosas buenas se hacen esperar).=
 After shaking your hand and, of course, exanimating every single detail of=
 your body and your beauty, I felt so eager to hear you speaking, to know a=
 little bit more about this gentleman that life has put in my path, just to=
 find out few minutes later that this lovely and handsome man was not only =
physically attractive but was a human full of interesting characteristics w=
orthy of this and more dinners ahead. It was in that moment that I knew som=
ething big was about to happen, but you know, experience is wise and =93the=
 Devil knows more for being old than for being Devil=94 (m=E1s sabe el Diab=
lo por viejo que por Diablo) so I decided to take this in slow motion and t=
ry not to put so much attention to what the destiny was screaming out loud.

Perhaps what came later was different for both of us, I tried to enjoy as m=
uch as possible every single second of your presence, to feel your muscle, =
to scent your skin, to taste your humor and in some way or another show you=
 how much I liked you and let us be honest, we enjoyed our encounters as th=
ere is no tomorrow. And we kept sharing our moments without affecting our n=
ormal working and social lives, without letting me get so much involved bec=
ause of my feelings, with no fear and no attachments. Sometimes I have been=
 so emerged in this come and go of life that I find myself surviving in the=
 present without thinking about what the future could hold, and in a matter=
 of a few months, the future arrived with its sharp teeth in the shape of a=
irplanes and distant lands, showing its enormous claws with airs of distanc=
e and farewells and you left.

This is not a sad story; this is just the beginning of an unwritten journey=
 that we both decided to make. To be honest, after you left I had not big e=
xpectations, actually I had none at all, but then you took your place and m=
ake what I call now the breath of salvation, and now it is my turn to thank=
 you for that, thank you for coming back and see me, thank you for reassure=
 how much we can build together and restore my faith in love.

Now, even though we have happy and not so happy moments together in the dis=
tance, I can feel you and you can be sure that on my side I am putting all =
my effort so this can go on.  I never thought I would say this but if we ha=
ve to suffer, then let=92s do it together. As that beautiful song you sent =
me, let=92s hurt tonight.

It is never too much to remember you how much I miss you, my babe.

Always yours


William Burbano
