Hey Albert,

Thanks for all your work with the classes. How has the attendance been?
I've heard from most of the other teachers that it hasn't been as high this
term as last term. We're trying to figure out what to do about that. I
think we've marketed with all the same people.

I don't normally go through the PPTs but that one looked great.

Cheers,
Adam
