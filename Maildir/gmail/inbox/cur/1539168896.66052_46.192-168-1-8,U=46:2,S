Hi Alberto=2C
Just a follow up email to last night as I felt I wrote it when I was in a r=
ush and probably came across as quite frenzied.
I have a bit of good news for now: my placement from next week is in a priv=
ate all-girls school! I find women are so much kinder and sweeter so even i=
f this is not the case=2C I can at least go into the school feeling good ab=
out it :)
I've found the course very challenging so far. I came home tonight wonderin=
g if I should stick it through or pull out. It is exposing all my weaknesse=
s. Getting up in front of people and speaking I find absolutely terrifying.=
 Having to discipline people (like Jonah from summer heights high haha) and=
 be an authority figure does not come naturally to me. Being 'fun' and outg=
oing is difficult especially when people are watching me.The assignments ar=
e killing me. I like to do a good job=2C but I find that I don't have enoug=
h time! I spoke before about how I have pride issues haha=2C and so I'm fin=
ding this a bit difficult to deal with and I get quite stressed.For next Tu=
esday I need to write a 70 bar composition for 8 instruments and an essay w=
orth 50%. I am still researching for it and am not sure if I'll be able to =
get through everything before then=2C but I have to somehow.
I just want you to be aware that when you come back=2C at least till this n=
ext Tuesday=2C I'm going to be a bit stressed and won't be able to spend as=
 much time with you as I'd like. I hope you understand!
After going through the past couple of weeks in the course=2C I'm more awar=
e than ever in the gaping flaws and weakness in my personality and become q=
uite despondent and frustrated.I'll need your support more than ever when y=
ou come back. I come home feeling deflated most days.
Sorry to be such a downer=2C but I just want you to understand what you're =
coming back to haha and to understand that I'll be fairly pressed for time =
this week and not to take it personally!
Thanks for being so kind to me.
Take care=2C
