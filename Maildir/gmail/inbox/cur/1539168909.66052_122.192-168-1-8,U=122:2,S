Hi guys,

I need to organise a new time for the technician to come out and inspect
the internet connection because he came out today and no one was home. Can
either of you give me a 4 hour window where you might be home to answer the
door for him so I can arrange the next appointment? I would appreciate this
because we are really busy at work at the moment and I cant afford to take
a day off. I imagine it just requires letting him in and pointing him
towards the router (my room)

Thanks,
Sophie
