Dear Albert=2C
It's past granny's bedtime but I want to write you a quick email before I g=
o to bed. It's lucky I can touch-type so that my eyes being closed is not a=
n issue haha. Tomorrow is my last day of holidays and I would like to do al=
l the reading for next week and take notes=2C so I think it will take most =
of tomorrow. I always struggle to know how much effort to put into things. =
I'm happy to take detailed notes for now=2C but I'm sure that as the semest=
er gets busier I won't have the luxury of time to do this!
The minimum for tonight is going to be over 30 degrees - this is higher tha=
n the monthly maximum. I'm going to have get out my desk fan again! It's be=
en a very hot February so far.
I went to the orientation for the teaching course. It was quite long=2C ove=
r two hours without a break. I was busting to go to the toilet most of the =
time=2C but I was right at the end of the row against the wall! It's amazin=
g that it's ranked three in the world=2C behind Harvard and Cambridge appar=
ently. It'll be great to start to fully see how it got to be ranked so high=
. Being a music teacher has the possibility of being really fun. It's alway=
s nice to dream how good things can be=2C especially at this time of night =
haha. I'm finding I'm a lot more motivated for this course. It seems very w=
ell run and it's nice having good employment prospects at the end of it=2C =
not like the course I've been doing the past four years!I'm going to join t=
he Gospel choir this Tuesday. It goes till fairly late so it's lucky I've g=
ot Wednesday off. I'm not sure if I told you but I scheduled all my classes=
 on Monday and Tuesday. 9-5:15 and 9-6:15 with a one hour break at 11. I'm =
not sure how I'm going to survive haha. A lot of being a music teacher requ=
ires running ensembles=2C so this choir will give me regular experience in =
being in one.
Speaking of exercise=2C I actually ended up going on that bike ride I was t=
alking about=2C but I haven't been since haha. I went on the Capital City t=
rail into the city via Docklands. Have you been on this? The most memorable=
 bit was dodging the pedestrians in Southbank in front of all those fancy r=
estaurants haha.
That's cool that your mum's paying for you to go on an adventure. You may f=
ind you learn more about yourself through it than with books haha. This is =
why this year will be good for me. The challenge will crush me and hopefull=
y I'll be able to put back the pieces and will be extra strong in future.
Have a good time and it's not long now till you're back! The week after you=
 come back my first assignment is due and placements start - all less than =
a month away!
Take care and wishing you were here=2C
