Hi Nicole,How are you? This is to advise you that I will not be renewing my=
 part of the lease after 17 July as I will be moving overseas. Albert and I=
 have already talked about it and he has decided to stay in the flat and lo=
ok for someone to take over my part of the lease. We understand that the po=
tential new tenant will have to go through the same process Albert went thr=
ough when he took over Emma's lease last year. Albert and I will update you=
 once we find someone to replace me. Thank you very much.
Kind regards,Marlon
