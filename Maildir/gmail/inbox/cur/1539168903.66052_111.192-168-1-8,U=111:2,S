Hi guys,

I called Optus about cancelling our internet account to check if there will
be any fees. As we are not 'in contract' at the moment, we won't have any
fees if we wish to cancel and change service providers (Albert, Tom has
done some research on better deals and we think the one we would go with
would be Iprimus unlimited downloads, $70 per month with a $140 start up
fee).

When I called Optus they offered us a similar deal, unlimited downloads for
$80 per month with no initial fee because we're already connected.

I feel as though Optus have been quite misleading with our current plan,
'120gb naked plan' which as it turns out was actually a 50gb plan with 70gb
between 2am-6am.

Both Iprimus and Optus would lock us into a 12 month contract, and for a 12
month period, Optus works out to be cheaper overall and I suppose there
would be a bit of a delay and disruption to our service if we change
providers.

Let me know what you guys think because I'm pretty much on the fence.

Sophie
