Hey Albert,

Just an email to remind you about the rent increase effective this Thursday
13/3, to $730. :'(
Also how was your first week of uni last week?
Oh and I got your transfer for the remaining bill. The next one is the
internet, due 18/3, but because you were only here half of the time, just
pay half, $10.

Also some time last week we got a letter from the real estate agent, they
want all our names on the lease and to do that it will cost us $110. So we
have to divide this amount by 4 (myself, yourself, Tom and Alistair
(previous tenant) ) so it will cost $27.50 each. We don't have to do this
right away, but sooner would be better. It's really a pain but technically
it should have been done when you moved in.  We will also need to fill in
the form, it's on the table in the living room.

Let me know if you have any questions,

Sophie
