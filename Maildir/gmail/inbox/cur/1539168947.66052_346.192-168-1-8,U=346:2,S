Hi Albert,

I see, thank you for the information. I've adjusted my class timetable from
the Wed evening to Tue evening so I'll be able to attend the Chinese Class
on Wed evenings.

I also appreciate the way you taught the Chinese materials and the clear
accent you had when you gave the pronounciation examples, it had helped a
lot.

Enjoy your winter break!
Best regards,
Frans
