Hi everyone,

The last week of Chinese classes is finally here! Thank you all so much for
your hard work. We have had a great attendance rate this semester, which
reflects well on the whole team.

Two things for this Wednesday night:

1. I'm going to give you all surveys to pass out in class that I'll pick up
after class. I know you're all great teachers but please tell students to
be honest and critical, we want to know where we can improve. Honest
results are important because we're looking at providing a payment to
teachers next semester and we want to be able to show that it improves
student outcomes.

2. I want to give you all thank-you cards as a token of appreciation on
behalf of the MCLS and your students. Please come along to room 605 after
class. Alternatively, let me know if I can give it to you another time.

Best regards,

Adam
