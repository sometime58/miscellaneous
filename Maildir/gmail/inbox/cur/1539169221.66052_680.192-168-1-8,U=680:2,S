Hi Abby, Aohan, Kaixi, Nora, Yifan and Yiyue,

I received some bad news from the law school yesterday, we=E2=80=99re going=
 to have
to move the Chinese classes to Wednesday nights because the Debating
Society has booked up all of the rooms on some Tuesday evenings. It will
still be the same time (6:30-7:30pm) and in the same weeks (week 2 - week
9), just on Wednesdays instead of Tuesdays.

I realise this may cause problems for some of you if you have other
commitments on Wednesday evenings. Please let me know if you won't be able
to teach on Wednesday nights.

I apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.

Best regards,


*Adam Spottiswood*
Education Director
Melbourne China Law Society
