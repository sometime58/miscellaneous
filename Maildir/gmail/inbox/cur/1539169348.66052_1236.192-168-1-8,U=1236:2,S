Hi Aohan,

Thank you for posting that very interesting article. 

I am a little curious, however, how Maki and Maki argued that online testing can break an intimidating amount of work into more manageable chunks. Do you think they mean that it is easier for teachers to write online tests, or easier for students to study for and complete an online test? Or maybe both? 

And why do you think that Saloman and Gavriel argue that students are engaged by online testing? 
I am of the opinion that students are engaged by online quizzes as it usurps the traditional pen-on-paper assessment model. Indeed, whether we like it or not, computing is a fundamental aspect of contemporary youth culture and identity in Australia. I think that by delivering online tests to secondary students, it is vicariously appropriating and subsequently legitimizing the way young people communicate and socialise in modern Australian society. 

Please feel free to contradict me if you think my logic is flawed.
