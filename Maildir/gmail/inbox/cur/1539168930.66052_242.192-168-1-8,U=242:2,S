Hi Albert,

We have had a bit of drama with the real estate agent this month. As a
result we are having an inspection this Monday 30/3. I'll try and be home
for it, but let me know if you think you will be home. And just try and
keep things tidy over the next few days, I'll do some cleaning on Sunday.

Also there has been some bills roll in -

Internet (March) - $27.40

Electricity - $94.20

Gas - $44.41

*Total $166*

I'll stick the bills up on the pinboard tonight.

Hope uni is going well,

Sophie
