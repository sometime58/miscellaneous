Hello:

Thank you very much for your interest in High Resolves and your application
for the role of Citizenship and Leadership Program Teacher/Facilitator.

We've just completed our review of applicants and unfortunately, we're
unable to proceed further with your application.

We've received a large number of applications of a very high standard and
an overwhelming level of passion for developing citizenship and leadership
skills in young people. The core of the Program Teacher/Facilitator role is
engaging with large groups of high school students within a school
environment, and the correct mix of enthusiasm and relevant experience have
been significant factors in our shortlisting of candidates.

I'd usually try to give personalised feedback to each applicant, but the
sheer volume of high quality applications has driven the need for providing
this broadcast feedback. Please accept my apologies for the absence of a
personal response, and feel free to call me on 9671 7079 if you'd like some
quick feedback.

I sincerely thank you for your interest in the role and High Resolves more
broadly, and I wish you all the best in your efforts to make the world a
better place.

- Elizabeth
