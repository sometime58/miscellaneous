Dear Albert=2C
I'm not sure if I told you about the fireworks in Port Macquarie around New=
 Year? They 'only' went for 15 minutes but for all that time I felt the del=
ight of a child.We forgot to bottle some of the Botanic Gardens' air for yo=
u to counter the smog in Beijing. I don't think you had enough room left in=
 your suitcase in any case!
I don't understand most of the words in Wodehouse myself haha. It would be =
an excellent way to build up vocab if ever one felt the need to sound 'soph=
isticated'. Sophisticated to me means 'confusing the other person so they t=
hink I'm so wonderfully intelligent (despite the fact I don't even know wha=
t I mean!)'
In regards to food=2C I'm not very good with meats that I'm not used to. I'=
m fine with chicken=2C 'cow'=2C 'pig' and to an extent lamb=2C but the thou=
ght of eating other animals is repellent to me. I'm sure the thought of eat=
ing animal full stop would be unattractive to me if I wasn't brought up on =
it! Examples of common 'animals' I'm not used to include duck and seafood.
I'm not very good at losing unfortunately! At least it raises the stakes fo=
r the game haha. I think I tie too much of my pride into what I do rather t=
han who I am. I'm starting to change this a bit. Not really caring if I'm g=
ood at what I do - instead judging myself on character. I've been trying to=
 only say nice things about people. Can you imagine me doing this haha? I t=
hink I'm doing a fine job of it so far. Bitching is fun=2C but it doesn't m=
ake you feel all that good about yourself!
It may be for the best that you don't light fireworks. Some risks are worth=
 taking. Some examples include riding a bike for exercise=2C applying for a=
 job you're scared about (both of which I'm currently putting off haha - Mr=
 hypocrite!) Potentially injuring yourself for the sake of a few bangs may =
not be the best idea!
I got myself a tablet so that I can work in at uni. It was quite a confront=
ing experience setting it up - you know how out of my depth I am with techn=
ology! I like to keep things fairly simple and confidential=2C except I fou=
nd this tablet very complicated and it seemed to want to know everything ab=
out me! Everything is linked in to my email address and some 'cloud' (which=
 I still have very little grasp of haha). Even your documents are saved to =
the internet by default and not to your own computer. Going through the pri=
vacy info shocked me on how much they know about everything you're doing an=
d looking up online. I hate being videoed as everyone knows but today every=
one has cameras and video cameras on their phone=2C so there is no escape h=
aha. I think I need to get used to the idea that nothing is private anymore=
!
I've gone swimming twice in the last three days. I'm soooo slow. I've been =
lucky as I've been able to have the lane to myself both times - otherwise I=
 would have seriously held up the 'traffic' haha. I went to a different bea=
ch yesterday - Frankston which is probably the furthest I've gone in Victor=
ia away from Melbourne since I've been living here!A few days ago I went lo=
oking around the posh hotels for pianos and came across quite a few - now I=
 just need to be brave enough to ask to play! I find the perfect and wealth=
y atmosphere a bit intimidating haha. Me and my stepsister went up to one o=
f the top floors of one of the hotels and found that the restrooms (of all =
places!) gave an amazing view over the Botanic Gardens area.
They're the main things at least. I'm enjoying my last week of freedom befo=
re uni goes back. I need to start getting organised but I'm so not in the m=
ood haha.
Do you know what time your flight arrives into Melbourne?It will be wonderf=
ul to have you back. I am quite prone to feeling lonely.Hopefully I'll be b=
ack on the bike before you get back. I'm planning to go tomorrow=2C but kno=
wing me I'll probably think of some excuse haha.
Have a good few days - missing you=2C
