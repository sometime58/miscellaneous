Dear Albert,

This Saturday, 4 October will mark 13 years since the SAIL Program was born! 

A reminder that the celebration will be held at Footscray Community Arts Centre, 45 Moreland Street, Footscray. The celebrations will start at 11am and conclude by 1:15pm. 

We are looking for volunteers to help run a badge-making stall on the day, and to help supervise the perimeter of the birthday venue. Please let us know which of these you are willing to help with! 

For cake bakers, your culinary contribution would be especially welcome at this celebration. Please bring them with you. 

We are looking forward to a fantastic day! Thanks for being part of SAIL as we mark this special Birthday. 

Smooth SAILing,
Nyssa Watson, Malang Deng, Alex Heath & Yoshi Inada-Lane
