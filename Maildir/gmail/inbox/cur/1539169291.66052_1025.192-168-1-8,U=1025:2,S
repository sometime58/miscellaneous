Hi Matthew and Aohan,

How are you doing?

I've made some updates on our group rubric spreadsheet, feel free to have a
look and edit.

I am not sure if I am going down the right track as it seems too much for
one rubric as we only need to design two rubrics with totally 7 criteria,
well, "at least". Perhaps we could split it into 2 rubrics, while the first
is for fraction only and the second is for decimal and percentage, or the
first is purely for numerical operation and second is for applying
mathematical thinking to problem solving. How do they sound like? Pretty
dummy, isn't it. Please help me fix any syntax error or inappropriate or
wrong use of words.

Anyway, please let me know how you guys feel.

Have a very wonderful weekend~

Cheers

Bao
