Dear Albert=2C
I'm writing this email very quickly because I currently don't have a life! =
I spent most of the day in the library today and I still haven't done all t=
he required readings for this week. I didn't even get on to any assignments=
! I've got one worth 50% due next Tuesday and I still haven't finished the =
research stage! This isn't to mention getting ready for the group meeting o=
n Wednesday. I just don't know how I'm going to get it all done! I'm sure I=
'll panic majorly about the essay very soon and probably stay up till the m=
orning getting it finished. But granny finds this difficult and I'm not goi=
ng to resort to that just yet!
The weather has been hot this month - on average over 30. So it's been weir=
d the past few days - it's been around 20 and life has had a different feel=
 about it. Complaining is not only healthy=2C but it's so much fun. I love =
complaining! It's much more boring to try to do something about it haha. I =
always got 'good listener' as well from everybody. I think people like seei=
ng me just so that they can have someone to talk at for as long as they wis=
h haha=2C without fear of much interruption.
I hope you get better before you come back! I struggle getting all my thing=
s done when I'm healthy=2C so I can't afford to get sick haha. Maybe it'll =
give me an excuse to get extensions on all the assignments!=20
Speaking of John Mayer=2C artists sure are funny and likely to go off the r=
ails 'a la' Justin Bieber. It's worse when they cease being famous. They're=
 whole self worth hinges on their success and universal approval so when it=
 disappears it's crushing for so many of them.
I'm learning so many things about myself by doing this course! I had to do =
this mini teaching example in class and found that my voice completely chan=
ged - it was a lot deeper than usual haha. It is weird telling people what =
to do. Leadership is a funny thing to me. It is looked upon so highly and y=
et all it is is bossing other people around! It is an uncomfortable feeling=
 but I don't have much choice haha. I may even come to like it!
Sorry it's such a short email but you'll be back very soon! It sure is gett=
ing very exciting!
When did you want to meet up on Wednesday? :)
See you very soon! :D
