Dear Albert=2C
I'm in bed writing to you as I'm pretty exhausted. I got to sleep after 1am=
 this morning and the light woke me up at around 7=2C which is 2 hours earl=
ier than I wake up in a dark room!
It is funny being back in Melbourne. I miss my family. I need to see someon=
e soon coz I feel very lonely. It is weird being around people you love for=
 over a month and then suddenly I am alone. It really hit me this afternoon=
. It made me realise how different it is to live with people who you are af=
fectionate about. You'll need to hurry up and come back here haha.
I was jubilant last night. I was really nervous about coming 'home' and see=
ing Mari after we had the awful fights just before I left. I was greatly re=
lieved that she wanted to go back to being on good terms as well. What a re=
lief! It is nice to live with someone who doesn't hate you too much! I was =
talking to someone on the train about my fears and she said that it sounds =
as though she needs someone to listen to her perspective. I've realised tha=
t I don't need to change her thinking or say my perspective. It is great ju=
st having someone to listen to your views. I find them quite heated usually=
=2C and this automatically makes me want to disagree=2C but obviously this =
never does any good.
I went to the Windsor today all dressed up to ask to play the piano. The pe=
ople at reception gave me the business card of the person to contact. But m=
y mood deteriorated rapidly throughout the day so I haven't followed it up =
yet. Something to do when I'm feeling good! I felt a little bit unworthy in=
 the setting. Playing in a restaurant in Wagga is one thing=2C but the swan=
kiest hotel in Victoria is quite another. I'm just glad that I was feeling =
happy enough in the morning to go in. I hate my voice. I was nervous at the=
 reception and my voice was shaking! You should have heard me talk to Mari =
last night about being back on good terms. Quivering. I just hope I'm not l=
ike this in front of a class haha.
One great thing about travel is it gives one plenty to talk about and hence=
 more conversation=2C which makes it a bit easier to strike up friendships.=
 It's crazy how diverse the languages of China are! It is amazing how unive=
rsally standard the English language is even between countries on the other=
 side of the world! Travelling with people has its pros and cons. From my e=
xperience of wandering around today by myself=2C traveling solitary would b=
ecome lonely very quickly unless one was outgoing enough to easily talk to =
strangers. And then with people=2C disagreements can arise as you may want =
to do different things! How do you find travelling with others?
You're lucky that you're so adventurous with your eating! I wish I could be=
 haha. Different food is a scary challenge to me for some reason! Is there =
any hope for me haha.
It's a pity to hear about the loss of culture. The westernisation of the wo=
rld is making it become more and more similar. There's something romantic a=
bout the past. Modernity can often be seen as frenetic and trashy. Horns bl=
earing=2C rubbish everywhere. I've really noticed how overwhelming the city=
 is after being away. All the hustle and bustle really gets to me sometimes=
. People love drama!
I came home via Macaulay station and walked back the way that we have many =
times before. It was sad to do it all alone.
Take care and bon voyage!
Missing you=2C

Good day/evening Lach=2C=0A=

 =0A=
=0A=
It=92s good to hear you=92ve kept all the things you do well=0A=
organised. Living a regular life surely makes one feel chilled and peaceful=
 in=0A=
mood. I can imagine how wonderful the music you played in the restaurant. H=
ow much=0A=
I hope right now that I was there. It=92s always nice you can do something =
you=0A=
love without hoping for getting any benefit from it. that means you truly l=
ove=0A=
it that even if there aren=92t any monetary things as the result of you eff=
ort=2C you=0A=
still enjoy what you are doing. But as a matter of fact we all get payback =
from=0A=
things we like to do- happiness=2C considered to me the most important thin=
g=0A=
among all in one=92s life time. (by the way=2C hope the treat of the restau=
rant was=0A=
good haha)=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
Yunnan is definitely a place far away. We took plane here=0A=
arriving at Lijiang=2C and then an hour of bus ride to where we live. I=92m=
 here=0A=
with only other two since one guy cancelled due to some family business. Th=
e scenery=0A=
is totally different from that in Beijing of course. Less people and less=
=0A=
traffic for sure. We live in a hotel in a small town. The decoration here l=
ooks=0A=
like really ancient and old fashioned=2C but meanwhile this whole place has=
 been=0A=
completely commercialised. No one really lives in here. They open shops and=
=0A=
restaurants and hotels all over the place. So there aren=92t many things to=
 see=0A=
and also not the way I imagined before we came. We=92ve tried quite a few l=
ocal=0A=
dishes=2C some of which are really spicy. I mean=2C really really spicy. so=
me people=0A=
may travel by their eyes=2C or ears. I=92d say I travel by my tongue. Whene=
ver I go=0A=
to a place=2C I go straight to the restaurants and order as much as I can e=
at. The=0A=
taste of food is so unique and lively and it retains the memory to your min=
d=0A=
for a long while. And next time when you throw food down to your throat all=
=0A=
those memories will come back and you can trace back the story of =91I reme=
mber=0A=
when=85=92 But you can see how funny it is that Mds and pizza huts are even=
 more=0A=
popular than most of the chinese restaurants here to young people. It seems=
 the=0A=
whole country has been westernised not only areas like Beijing and Shanghai=
. But=0A=
what can I say=2C even during yesterday when we were walking along the stre=
et=0A=
looking for a place to go=2C we saw this KFC and we went in for lunch. I ha=
ve to=0A=
say that was the most fantastic lunch among four we had in Yunnan. =0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
People drink a lot alcohol. it says all men here have to do=0A=
seven things in their lifetime according to the tradition- cigarette=2C alc=
ohol=2C=0A=
string instruments=2C chess=2C handwriting=2C drawing and tea. But after th=
e past few=0A=

. Lucky for=0A=
me I wasn=92t born here. =0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
It just rained yesterday=2C while it was even above 0 degree=0A=
outside. The snow came down and melted immediately. It was beautiful and od=
d at=0A=
the same time. It=92s been the worst exercise I=92ve been doing here walkin=
g all=0A=
day and not able to fall asleep. Right now I=92m exhausted but still there =
are=0A=
many more places to go. I=92ll probably not make it and choose to stay in m=
y room=0A=
tomorrow sleeping all day. Hope I can gain my strength back soon. =0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
But after all I find travelling inspiring. It feels like there=0A=
are so many things you don=92t know about until you finally reach there. Pe=

in a complete different accent and we=92ve got a huge problem understanding=
. This=0A=
is also reciprocal. When talking to locals=2C none of us could fully unders=

each other. So guessing and slow repetitions did most of the work here. The=
y also=0A=
have a new language spoken by people of certain background. The pronounce i=

tely=0A=
different so no literally one to one translation. What=92s interesting is t=

We are heading to Dali by train tomorrow- it=92s like another=0A=
suburb where travellers go (as a matter of fact we don=92t have such a noti=
