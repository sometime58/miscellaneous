Dear All,

My name is Adam Spottiswood, I am the new Education Director for the
Melbourne China Law Society (MCLS). I will be organising the MCLS Chinese
classes at the Melbourne Law School this semester.

I am writing to you to find out if you would like to teach these classes
again this semester.

We are planning to change the class times to Tuesday evenings at 6:30pm,
starting on Week 3 of Semester 2 (Tuesday 10 August).

Please let me know if you would like to be involved again this semester.
Also, please let me know if you know anyone else who you think would like
to teach these classes.

Best regards,

Adam Spottiswood
