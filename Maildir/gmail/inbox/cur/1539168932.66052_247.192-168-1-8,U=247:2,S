Dear Albert,

At SAIL, we have a comprehensive Child Protection Policy. It is very important that all volunteers are familiar with this document. The full text of the policy is available on our website (www.sailprogram.org.au - just scroll down on the front page to access the link), or you can just click here: https://drive.google.com/a/sailprogram.org.au/file/d/0B7r5QohjR5kYSHptcXpDbXR4QTA/view?usp=sharing

We have made several updates to the policy for 2015. For your reference, here is a document that summarises these updates: https://drive.google.com/a/sailprogram.org.au/file/d/0B7r5QohjR5kYXzFfZjdqRTBVSms/view?usp=sharing

Thank you very much for familiarising yourself with these important documents. 

Smooth SAILing,
