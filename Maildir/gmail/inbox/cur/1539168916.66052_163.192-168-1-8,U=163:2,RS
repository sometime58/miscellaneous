Hi Albert,

The bill for the electricity each is $171.50. It was quite expensive for
the winter period so next time we cross paths in the hall i will show you
how to use the gas heating because gas heating is always less expensive
than electric heating.

Also i have left a bunch of stationary things i don't  need on the lounge
table. Take whatever you want, i will throw it all out tuesday

Sophie
