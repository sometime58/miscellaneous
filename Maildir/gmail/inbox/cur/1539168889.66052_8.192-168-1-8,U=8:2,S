Dear Albert=2C=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
It is good having the excuse to write to you. The only=0A=
downside I see is that you may actually get to know me well with the likely=
=0A=
result you may never want to set eyes on me again!=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
It seems obvious to start with the all important =91what I=92ve=0A=
been doing=92=2C not that there is much left to talk about once naps have b=
een=0A=
taken into account. My preferred way to kill time is reading. I have someho=
w=0A=
got it into my head that it is =91better=92 or =91more productive=92 than w=
atching=0A=
things=2C which is bizarre considering how long it takes!=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
Yesterday I finished yet another book about the Alexander=0A=
Technique =96 the last for the next little while! All books can be summaris=
ed in=0A=
two pages. I wafted through nearly 300 pages where the same things were=0A=
highlighted again and again in different scenarios. I persevered as I liked=
 his=0A=
prose and find reading comforting for some reason. It sure is easier than=
=0A=
looking for a job for instance!=0A=
=0A=
I=92ve now proceeded onto the book you=92ve loaned me: sex sleep=0A=
eat drink dream. I haven=92t got up to the sleep part yet=2C so most of my =
day=0A=
still remains a mystery. It has a lot of interesting facts. It is mostly=0A=
research findings loosely tied into a narrative of sorts. I=92m always scep=
tical=0A=
of research findings =96 I feel it=92s hard to know what causes what. =91Pe=
ople with=0A=
a better diet are more likely to succeed=92 for instance. It=92s not so muc=
h the=0A=
diet that causes success. The mentality behind eating well and working hard=
 are=0A=
the same: bettering yourself. But this is completely beside the point.=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
I=92ve been keeping up the DVD watching at night. I=92ve watched=0A=
two Agatha adaptations with Miss Marple: The Body in the Library and The=0A=
Sittaford Mystery. I read them a few years ago so I watched them as it woul=
dn=92t=0A=
give anything away. However in both cases the murderers were different from=
 the=0A=
books! In the first case=2C it was committed by Lesbian lovers. Queer peopl=
e of=0A=
any type are not really a part of Agatha=92s world! And in the second one t=
he=0A=
whole story was different except the setting =96 I don=92t know how they ca=
n=0A=
justify using the title! But it was entertaining nonetheless. =0A=
=0A=
Last night I started watching a comedy called =91Nighty=0A=
Night=92. It is pure evil! Which probably explains why I enjoyed it so much=
. The=0A=
main character makes Ja=92mie look like an angel. If you=92re up for a bit =
of=0A=
nastiness we can try it out when you get back! That=92s if I make it throug=
h the=0A=
school placement of course.=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
I=92ve been for the occasional walk. The past few days (except=0A=
today because those little specks of rain were enough to defeat this old la=
dy)=0A=
I=92ve been library hopping. Baillieu=2C ERC=2C State=2C City. I had some M=
D=92s=0A=
yesterday =96 old habits die hard! This is the first day that I haven=92t h=
ad=0A=
takeaway in ages! I=92ve been keeping a budget with my daily limit of $10.=
=0A=
Needlessness to say I=92m in severe deficit at the moment. I think a few da=
ys of=0A=
starvation should do the trick. =0A=
=0A=
It is amazing what a walk does to me. If inside for long=0A=
periods of time=2C I feel like ending it all. But a short walk and everythi=
ng is=0A=
roses once more. The marvels of getting those legs in action.=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
Today I=92ve spent most of my time writing. I live through my=0A=
notebook. It is rarely about everyday matters but just general life matters=
.=0A=
What=92s all this life thing about? How should I use my time? Why am I so=
=0A=
paranoid? And other such wishy-washy things. =0A=
=0A=
The unfortunate thing is that any answers breed more=0A=
questions until the complexity becomes unbearable and you realise that mayb=
e=0A=
there aren=92t any neat answers.=0A=
=0A=
I often come up with temporary solutions to my existential=0A=
malaise. However after a while they break down and I am left clueless once =
more=0A=
with walks being my primary salvation! Life seems a cycle of solution and=
=0A=
cluelessness=2C solution and cluelessness. I am currently in a clueless pha=
se=0A=
haha. I think this is the one and only phase: every =91solution=92 crumbles=
 after a=0A=
while.=0A=
=0A=
In the second semester of last year and the first of this=0A=
year I was very interested in Eastern philosophy and the mysticism of Alan=
=0A=
Watts. This semester I have swung to the opposite extreme and have become v=
ery=0A=
Western=2C being interested in Russel and the British analytical school in=
=0A=
general=2C which the Alexander technique ties into in some ways.=0A=
=0A=
However=2C recently I=92ve started to become a bit disillusioned=0A=
with this. It is a very practical way of living and of seeing the world=2C =
but it=0A=
may leave one feeling a little cold and mechanical=2C which such a cold-hea=
rted=0A=
individual such as myself may not need any more of! =0A=
=0A=
To me=2C it leads to a serious view of life. I am a very=0A=
serious person=2C however I realise that seriousness is the most undesirabl=
e=0A=
quality and has the effect of making life a living hell. I feel that any ch=
ance=0A=
I have of throwing of =91existential malaise=92 is when I fully comprehend =
that=0A=
life is by nature not serious and that our problems only result from a seri=
ous=0A=
way of looking at life. However=2C pigs have a better chance of flying than=
 me=0A=
ever losing my seriousness!=0A=
=0A=
The Western ideal is obsessed with the notion of progress=0A=
and attainment=2C which implies a serious view of the world. Not that I wou=
ld=0A=
have it any other way=2C given the liberty and safety that these ideals hav=
e=0A=
resulted in.=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
Life is cruel. Being human is frustrating and difficult.=0A=
Desiring answers in a world that will never give you any. Striving=2C knowi=
ng=0A=
that it is futile. But I feel that liberation is gained from its futility. =
How=0A=
can we take such futility seriously? =0A=
=0A=
No one disputes life is miraculous. No one disputes it can=0A=
often be enjoyable. But I will always assert that it is not easy. The solut=
ions=0A=
we create for ourselves often create further harm.=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
Despite all this=2C it is very interesting. I hold the=0A=
conviction in my heart that life can be immensely enjoyable but only from a=
=0A=
certain perspective=2C which I am yet to fully realise. Maybe this is anoth=
er=0A=
part of the cruel game =96 I always feel I am on to something=2C only to be=
 shown=0A=
that it is a wrong way of viewing things!=0A=
=0A=
Who knows=2C maybe one day all my angst will not be in vain? I=0A=
guess my greatest wish is not to be at the whim of my worries which are suc=
h a=0A=
presence in my life =96 and for that matter everyone=92s lives!=0A=
=0A=
I repeat=2C fighting things head on often makes them worse. I=0A=
feel a change of perspective may be more helpful.=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
I have a remarkable ability on making everything sound=0A=
pessimistic. However I don=92t really see myself as a pessimist. I wouldn=
=92t=0A=
bother with these sort of things if I thought life was a waste. I know that=
=0A=
much happiness comes from having the worst as the default and that acceptin=
g=0A=
anything good as a wonderful bonus! And it is surprising the amount of good=
=0A=
that does happen.=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
When I have written to people in the past I=92ve toyed with=0A=
having a negative version (like the one I write by default!) and another on=
e=0A=
talking about the same sort of things in a positive light. This is just to =
show=0A=
that the same things can be transformed by the perspective. I like the nega=
tive=0A=
side as I feel every human to some degree finds life frustrating. However=
=2C most=0A=
of the time people usually only display their positive fa=E7ade=2C which ma=
kes=0A=
people feel all the more alone with their worries and problems.=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
I think this will do me. I don=92t mind how long your reply is=0A=
of course. I just sit and ramble until I=92ve had enough! Next time=2C I wi=
ll=0A=
hopefully not be so serious=2C though don=92t count on it!=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
You know that this cold-hearted machine has difficulties in=0A=
verbally expressing affection=2C especially along soppy and clich=E9 lines.=
 Suffice=0A=
to say I wish you were here! I miss your snuggles and companionship. =0A=
=0A=
It is not what is said that counts=2C but the willingness to=0A=
spend time with one another=2C when it is possible! This is love.=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
I bet the penguin is loving it there!=0A=
=0A=
