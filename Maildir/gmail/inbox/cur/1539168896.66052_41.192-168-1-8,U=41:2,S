Dear Alberto=2C
Happy Valentine's day!Thanks so much for the CD - I love John Mayer!It's fu=
nny he titled the album 'room for squares' (squares being conforming shy ne=
rdy types like me haha). He certainly doesn't live up to that description t=
hese days!
God=2C this week has been so intense. I promised myself I would put uni int=
o perspective and not stress out too much. But unfortunately this hasn't be=
en the case! I have quite a lot due already - 2 major assignments due less =
than 3 weeks from now!I consider myself lucky though. A lot of people in th=
e course are working or even have kids!
I'll write a longer email once I get on top on things in a few days time or=
 even sooner if I can free myself of the initial stress haha. Nothing much =
has happened except uni=2C being in by 9 every morning except Wednesday - G=
ranny doesn't cope too well with this haha. I have really amazing and diver=
se tutors. Some are very left wing=2C some are right wing. It makes for int=
eresting debate as I haven't fully made up my political views. My nice side=
 says left=2C but my pragmatic side says right haha.
Less than two weeks till you're back! You'll be able to get rid of penguin =
once you're back here haha =3B)
Take care and I'll hopefully email before Monday night!
