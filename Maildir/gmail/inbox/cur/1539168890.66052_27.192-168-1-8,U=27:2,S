Dear Alberto=2C
=20
I may have previously told you about my uncle who is larger than life. He l=
eft a few days ago to go back home to England. He left Australia at least a=
 decade ago to live over there. He seriously misses home out here but the r=
est of his family is settled over there.
I only bring this up because it makes you look at things in a different lig=
ht. He says that coastal New South Wales is his favourite place in the worl=
d and his love of it certainly is infectious. It makes you look on a famili=
ar scene in a completely new light.
=20
I'd love to go travelling too=2C but firstly I need an income haha. I reall=
y enjoyed the early chapters of Bill Bryson's book when it talked about the=
 cosmos (which I may have mentioned before). How insignificant we are in th=
e grand scheme of things is certainly humbling!
The conflict between nature and civilisation is a recurring theme. We certa=
inly can opt out of civilisation if we like but humans generally don't do s=
o as they like their comfort and convenience too much! It is unfortunate th=
at for humans to be comfortable and live in convenience=2C nature loses out=
.=20
Life has become very far removed from its origins and it seems to me someti=
mes that we're all a bunch of confused chimpanzees wondering what foreign w=
orld we belong too. But I can't talk as I seem to enjoy shutting myself awa=
y in manmade structures!

I've been back into walking in a big way the past few days. So much so that=
 I had to have a real nap today. I talk about my fondness for naps a bit bu=
t it's rare that I actually fall asleep during the day! The scenery on the =
coast is amazing - a lot nicer than the urban landscape I'm so used to. It'=
s a lot like a tropical rainforest.=20
I've also been at the glasshouse the past few days with the piano. I've pla=
yed the pieces so many times that it's nice that people think it's impressi=
ve! It's funny that the easier pieces often are the ones that people like t=
he most!
=20
My grandparents are both over 80 and have limited mobility and hence find i=
t difficult to perform basic household tasks like cooking and cleaning. So =
I've really enjoyed the past few weeks of being a domestic help. And never =
have there been more grateful recipients! I can see why people can enjoy so=
me aspects of parenting. It's a nice (powerful?) feeling having people so d=
ependent on you.
=20
I'm leaving Port Macquarie on Monday and am staying the night with a friend=
 from school in Sydney before heading back to Wagga Tuesday night and arriv=
ing at 3am on Wednesday! A few days later I'll be back in Melbourne where t=
he fun begins. The next few months will be very interesting!
=20
Take care=2C

Dear=0A=
Mr. Wolfielambie=2C=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
I=0A=
assume you=92ve had some of the greatest days with your family and in your=
=0A=
comfortable seaside summer. We are like living in two separate worlds and r=
ight=0A=
now I=92m enjoying my days next to the heater with my sweater and thick pan=
ts on.=0A=
Isn=92t it amazing there are so many things going on the same time we live =
and we=0A=
would never know what they are like until we actually go and take a look. I=
t=0A=
came to me all in a sudden yesterday that someday I=92d go to south America=
 and Europe=0A=
and maybe the woods covered under snow somewhere in Russia just to have the=
=0A=
experience what it=92s like to live in other places of different climate an=
d=0A=
views. I think travelling makes one realise how great the nature is and how=
=0A=
tiny we are compared to it. Yesterday when we drove up north to the mountai=
ns=0A=
close to where I live=2C when I face the large surface of water frozen to i=
ce and=0A=
when the wind came to me from the front=2C I thought I=92d never been more =
calm and=0A=
peaceful than I was. I came to think that we were all part of the nature by=
=0A=
origin but yet we=92ve gone so far away from it. there used to be a topic w=
e did=0A=
in philosophy tute that whether animals have souls. And according to some=
=0A=
theory from Kant (or it=92s just somebody else and I remembered it wrong)=
=2C they=0A=
don=92t and therefore they don=92t have emotions either=2C but we=2C as hum=
an beings=2C=0A=
have souls so that we can act freely in accordance to our will. Right now I=
 believe=0A=
so unswervingly that that=92s not true. I think nature has spirits. And may=
be we=0A=
are even just the small pieces of soul that finally come together and form =
the=0A=
whole of the nature. This might sound crazy but just to think=2C if we can =
be=0A=
built up by nucleus=2C then why can=92t we be the element of the nature as =
a whole.=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
Thinking=0A=
back=2C I used to have so many of my own philosophical theories of the univ=
erse=0A=
and how it=92s built. It=92s all the consequent result of what I was doing =
at the=0A=
time. When I studied mathematics=2C I thought it should come as the core of=
 the=0A=
universe. When I did logic=2C I thought it should rule all processes of the=
 whole=0A=
space. And know it=92s the nature. If I=92m not careful enough=2C maybe som=
eday I=92ll=0A=
be on my way to godliness and talking about unearthly souls all the time ha=
ha. =0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
You=0A=
were right in your letter. We do have preferences and always it=92s so hard=
 to=0A=
get rid of it. but as teachers I think=2C one of the most important thing i=
s to=0A=
avoid having preference upon students and don=92t let our emotion come in o=
ur way=0A=
of judging them. I believe in the theory that kids are like unstained paper=
s. They=0A=
learn and they get to know and they vary. There shouldn=92t be some power e=
ndowed=0A=
to learn in them before the birth or whatsoever until they are told what is=
=0A=
what. So we should treat them carefully with patience. The boy I talked abo=
ut=2C I=0A=
think the problem there was the parents didn=92t let him know what should a=
lways=0A=
be the right thing to do. People should always be polite and so forth. And =
also=2C=0A=
he=92s not even got the chance to know what it is he wants=2C due to the ov=
erprotection=0A=
on the part of their parents in his childhood=2C so now he worries and care=
s so=0A=
much about the material matters over anything else. Finding interest is=0A=
crucial. In some point=2C your interest defines who you are. =0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
Well=0A=
I haven=92t done much so I know feel I=92ve got nothing to tell you about. =
life=92s=0A=
become a bit boring lately and I=92m reading some books about ancient chine=
se=0A=
medical just for fun. Apparently the philosophy of yin and yan=2C along wit=
h so=0A=
many other things=2C take up a huge part of medical treatment in old times.=
 It=92s=0A=
like reading medical and philosophy at the same time. =0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
It=0A=
still hasn=92t snowed yet. Dry weather is killing me. Hope you take care of=

yourself well. =0A=
