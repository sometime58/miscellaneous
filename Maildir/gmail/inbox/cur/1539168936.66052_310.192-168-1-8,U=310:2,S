I know it's a little late... but don't forget to pay the NEW agent not the
OLD agent the rent! If you have any problems let me know and I will help!

Also we will be having a property evaluation with the new agent this *Thursday
at 4pm*. You're welcome to come along but it will be boring. Please make
sure your room is super dooper clean though because they need to be able to
see all the walls floors etc to mark any defects. VERY IMPORTANT!!!

Thanks,

Sophie
