Hi Albert,

Andreas has decided to move out with a couple of his friends, so I'm
currently looking for someone to take his room in the attic. I have shown a
few people the room but one of the people who saw it is quite tall and he
wanted to know if there was a possibility that you would take the attic
room (it's cheaper - $576 a month) and he would take your room. Let me know
if you do have a preference to change rooms, if I don't hear from you I
will assume you want to stay put, but I just thought I should offer it to
you first. Then again, you've probably not even ever seen Andreas' room....?
The ad on gumtree is
here<http://www.gumtree.com.au/m-my-ad.html?adId=1037004374> in
case you're interested.

Hope you are well,

Sophie
