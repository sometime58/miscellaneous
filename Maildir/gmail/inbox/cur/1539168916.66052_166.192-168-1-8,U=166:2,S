Dear Albert,

We hope all is well. We were hoping to see you on Saturday!

We just wanted to check to see how you were.

You can let us know if you're unable to come to SAIL via our online 'Can't Come' form, on the website: http://sailprogram.org.au/Pulse/really.php?option=Footscray  

Thanks for notifying us of your absence in advance, so we can make sure that your student/s have another tutor to teach them.

Feel free to contact us if you want to discuss anything. We really value your contribution to SAIL, and hope you'll be able to attend this coming week. We look forward to seeing you then!

Smooth SAILing,
Nyssa Watson, Malang Deng, Alex Heath & Yoshi Inada-Lane
