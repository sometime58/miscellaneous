Hi Alberto=2C
I'm slowly starting to pick up the pieces yet again haha. How many life cri=
ses can one guy have haha? In my previous course I was able to get away wit=
h 2.5 days of work per week=2C now I need to adjust to about 6.5 and I'm st=
ruggling to get used to. I need to start seeing working all the time as nor=
mal. Unfortunately=2C as I had so much time to do things in my last degree=
=2C my work methods are very convoluted though effective. Now I'm finding I=
 don't have enough time to do as well as I'd like=2C so I need to adjust to=
 that also. I need to also get used to less sleep and not napping all the t=
ime!A lot of the degree talks about authority and being strong=2C which I'v=
e been trying with very limited success. It has made me feel agree about ho=
w weak I am. For now I'll trial being nice to the students and only resorti=
ng to authority if they muck up too much.
Missing you too. I'm going to go to Big W tomorrow and get a shirt that isn=
't so tight around my neck!
Do you mind coming around here again? I'm sorry it's so one way - I don't m=
ind going around there.
How is 8:30 for you?
Cya then :)
