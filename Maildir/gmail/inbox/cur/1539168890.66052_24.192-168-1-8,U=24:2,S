Hi Alberto=2C
=20
Happy New Year! 2014 is going to be a weird year. Four years of comfort and=
 ease and now to go outside of my comfort zone! Let's hope I make it throug=
h!
=20
It's interesting hearing your stories. I feel sorry for the 15 year old. It=
's not easy helping people. I may be being hypocritical here=2C but giving =
advice is not usually helpful as people need to make mistakes in their own =
lives to learn. What others say without having had the personal experience =
doesn't mean much. And plus I always find advice so condescending! I hate i=
t. I always find it belittling. And usually the giver of advice is a hypocr=
ite anyway. What makes one person happy doesn't necessarily make another pe=
rson happy. Some people love helping out in the community while others pref=
er other things. I don't think the latter party should feel too inferior. I=
 think the former party does it largely for a sense of superiority and powe=
r.
=20
It sounds like he doesn't enjoy learning and finds it difficult. All this i=
s very natural. I guess the only way that can make it seem half worthwhile =
is that education coupled with a practical career is a way of becoming weal=
thy and buying all the clothes that he wants haha.=20
=20
It is interesting considering the role of parents. Support as number one. T=
hen instilling a sense of curiosity=2C which can be done through spending t=
ime together. And third=2C which I lack=2C is toughness and resilience! I t=
hink the main reason I'm so anxious is because I lack these traits.
I'm not sure if education can teach happiness. I think the best thing it ca=
n do is instil this curiosity and keep us occupied in the physical world so=
 that one doesn't sink down into an emotional trap as I am prone to.
=20
I've had a good few days. I've swum at the beach and have been battered aro=
und by the waves. My family are all so loud! I find I need to yell just to =
be heard. Family situations are always interesting. Being by myself most of=
 the time=2C I rarely consider how I appear from the outside=2C but I've be=
en put in sharp focus several times lately. A well-meaning relative asked: =
'You're great at playing piano so why don't you earn money playing somewher=
e?'
I felt like replying 'Coz I'm a loser'=2C but kept it to myself haha.
Incidentally=2C there's a piano at the tourist information/main entertainme=
nt centre in Port Macquarie called the Glasshouse. I played through some ea=
sy listening classics for nearly an hour. I'm going to go back there tomorr=
ow. It's nice gathering a few compliments haha.
I had my hair cut today - the first time since the queerspace end of semest=
er party. It kind of grew out into a Mohawk=2C but that's all gone now for =
the new year.
=20
A very happy new year to you!!!!

Hey Lachy=2C
=20
You are probably still squeezing in your grandparents=92 garage with the ot=
her three right now and in your sleep already. I just came back from my old=
 classmates New Year=92s party. It was a few days earlier before the actual=
 New Year=92s day but we still had a great deal of fun and the party was a =
huge blast.=20
=0A=
=20
I=92ve been in a kind of project helping troublesome adolescent these days.=
 it=92s just that we (my mom and I) were asked by a colleague of my dad=92s=
 to help try to talk to his son=2C as=2C alleged=2C we are =91the only peop=
le he=92s willing to have conversation with=92. ( fyi the two families are =
good friends and we used to be having family dinner all time before) This b=
oy of 15 year old is a trouble. He=92s rude and impervious to any kinds of =
helpful kindness and rather hard to talk to. The seemingly only interest of=
 his is the way he dresses and how other people look. Also he=92s do divulg=
ed in outfits and lifestyles and so on=2C and doesn=92t care about anything=
 more than superficial matters. He looks so arrogant and it always seems li=
ke he=92s not into talking to us whatsoever=2C which really gets on my nerv=
es. We weren=92t so eager to help after all and it seems like he is so not =
helpable as the problem he has traces back to some wrong ways of teaching b=
ack five or six years ago=2C which should the problem between him and his p=
arents. Looking at him=2C all in a sudden it got me think how important edu=
cation is and how parental companion is crucial to a child from the very be=
ginning. I find the huge impact a parent can ever have upon their children =
and after years of being together kids learn from their folks in terms of h=
ow to behave. Right now=2C this kid is hopeless of being helped as no vocal=
 suggestions and lecturing can ever be working out on him. He is not going =
to take any advice from anybody at all. He brought up that fact the past fe=
w days that he wanted to quit school and study no more. He also said studyi=
ng gets him dazzled and uncomfortable. Even things like reading and doing m=
aths give him great emotional burden and render him nauseated physically. A=
nd when it comes to what it is he wants to do for his life=2C he doesn=92t =
have any idea. This is dangerous that he thinks of life as meaningless and =
filled with boredom. I don=92t know if there is anything I could possibly d=
o to help him. Perhaps nothing at all. I just selfishly think that it=92s n=
ot me causing his problems at the first place so I=92ve got no responsibili=
ty and capacity to help him for good. And if there isn=92t anything I can e=
ver do to help=2C I=92ll just step back and admit my limitation of helping =
others. We are only human right?
=0A=
=20
I=92ve seen a lot of people educating their kids with the wrong technique. =
I don=92t mean to say I=92ve know all the truth about the =91correct educat=
ion=92 seeing that there will never be a best way of doing it. But some cer=
tain things I will regard as =91must do=92 or =91should never do=92. And ra=
ising kids is all about caring them and having time together. All sorts of =
manners and behaviours and the ways they think and look at things come from=
 the influence of their parents being with them years after years. As I may=
 have told you in my letters before=2C I always think the goal of education=
 is not to let them have great deal of income after they get a job=2C but t=
o help and guide them to come to know how to pursue true happiness. No matt=
er how much money you earn and what kind of thing you do=2C you always make=
 the best of you life and can be happy even though going through hard times=
. And most of all=2C help them know how to think and to make their own judg=
ment.
=0A=
=20
I think it=92ll be big challenge for you to do education the coming semeste=
r. But meanwhile I think you=92ll have great fun doing it and find yourself=
 having learnt a lot at the end of subjects. Your unwillingness to have gro=
up of people with you would perhaps change somehow then. But what do I know=
. Everyone has their own ways of dealing with social encounters. So do you.=
 It=92s just personally speaking=2C I would say it perhaps is better you be=
come sociable and talkative when other people are around. In my opinion we =
form as groups and society of man kind. And we all need other people to get=
 to know where our position is and to function as a social creature as that=
=92s the way we are. But then again=2C this is only what I think. And you p=
erhaps have the better answer to it.=20
=0A=
=20
I hope you are having a great time there and with your family. I think it=
=92s so nice you can read on your travelling. Reading on your journey is li=
ke two parallel stories going on at the same time=2C and one might find it =
distractive and burdensome. It=92s a precious quality you are able to read =
and to devote yourself into written words at all time. That almost doubles =
your travelling experience and reading will even make the actual travelling=
 more interesting and enjoyable.=20
=0A=
=20
I=92m going to bed. This is the second time I stay over in my old time dorm=
. Everything is going well so far. And wish you an early Happy New Year.=20
