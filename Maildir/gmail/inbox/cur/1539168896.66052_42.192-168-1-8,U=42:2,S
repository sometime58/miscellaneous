Dear Albert=2C
I still am yet to find some perspective in this course! Uni still seems lik=
e everything - it is never-ending. Once upon a time I did no work after din=
ner but now I find I need to keep working until I feel like I can't go on a=
ny longer.
Did I tell you I need to do a group assignment for one of my subjects? I ho=
pe it's not a nightmare scenario as many of them can be. I didn't know anyo=
ne in my group. I put myself down for my topic because two smart and cooper=
ative people put their names down for it - and then they switched to anothe=
r topic last minute and I was left there!Unfortunately=2C the only day that=
 we can meet is Wednesday and they can't meet this Wednesday=2C so we can o=
nly meet next Wednesday=2C which is the day you get back! The meeting is fr=
om 12-2. It's really horrible timing but we'll see each other all afternoon=
. It's a pity that I'm going to be really stressed out this semester so tha=
t I won't have no where near as much free time as in the holidays. Maybe we=
 could study together a lot? Mari is still insisting on doing at least 4 ho=
urs of piano practice on Saturday as well as Sunday so I'll be going to the=
 library a lot haha. And of course there's Wednesday.A large part of me is =
saying: it's just a stupid course - marks don't really matter. But it still=
 needs to get done regardless.It is so tempting to be lazy and do a quick j=
ob haha. I want to do well but I know that I just need to pass to get this =
qualification. Too much pride! We did a personality quiz in one of my subje=
cts and I got 'proud' haha. I haven't thought about this much=2C but maybe =
I am haha. I hate being embarrassed - can't stand it. My major motivation t=
o go well haha.
I'm thrilled to hear about the snow - what a pleasant surprise. It is a bit=
 like clover for me (as lame is this is haha). I used to enjoy playing in t=
he clover fields in my grandparents' farm. Someone would make tracks in it =
and then lie down and we'd follow the tracks to the person.Today was a litt=
le bit cooler here - the first time I haven't worn my shorts in ages. But h=
opefully I can go back to shorts tomorrow haha. You certainly will have mis=
sed the worst of Melbourne's summer!
I'm really glad you had a positive experience with your tutoring. Did you k=
now around 50% of graduate teachers leave the profession within the first 5=
 years? Teaching can be rewarding=2C but it's tough. Kids can be very cruel=
. Some people have it in them to do it=2C others don't. I'm not sure about =
myself - or how much I can charm kids into behaving haha. But I'll find out=
 soon. I need to be strong and resilient=2C but deep down I'm fragile and t=
he biggest pushover there ever was haha. I would love to not have a shaky v=
oice when I'm nervous! Hopefully some of the kids will feel sorry for me ha=
ha.
I'm envious of you right now in a certain way. It sounds so lovely being in=
 a safe and secure environment without too much responsibility. If I did no=
t need to work=2C I sure would opt for that haha. Instead I need to drag th=
is sensitive being through the 'real world' and hope it doesn't crumble too=
 much. I just wish I was a bit stronger and more efficient. I take forever =
to get anything done and drag it out way too long.I love to complain haha.
Since uni's gone back I've gotten into a bit of a rut. A lot less exercise =
and socialising. I'll try to get myself a bit more balance. And perspective=
! It's so easy to take things seriously. I wish I didn't care so much haha.=
 People who care a little bit but not much are blessed with an accurate per=
spective.
I have great tutors - very diverse. Education is such a contentious issue. =
What is it for? What effects does it have on young people and so forth. I t=
hink that it can be very beneficial and very harmful depending on how it's =
used. What a very general statement haha. I wonder if I'd be any happier if=
 I wasn't educated haha.
Things are relatively good though. Just as I've said=2C uni has just really=
 overwhelmed me this week and I'm still seeking to get a better balance. No=
t being able to study in my bedroom due to the piano practice doesn't help =
matters. But I'm sure there would be problems anywhere you live. Maybe it w=
ill encourage me to stop studying for a while haha.
As you know people have always mystified me. Sometimes I think I should sto=
p being so fussy and try to get along with everyone. But I'm realising I ce=
rtainly have my preferences. It's all in the voice for me. I like someone b=
ecause of their voice - that's usually all haha. Really camp gay voices are=
 such a turn off for me! It is the window to the soul for me - one's own in=
strument which reveals so much about a person. I have an ok voice in one on=
 one setting but it's very weak and I have trouble projecting it. This will=
 be my biggest challenge in a classroom. Not raising my voice=2C just proje=
cting it.
I'll need to plan some other activities for the week=2C or else all I'll se=
e in front of me are mountains of assignments and readings!
That's enough complaining from me for one night! I'm sure many of my proble=
ms would be solved if only I had a good level of self-discipline. I think I=
'm too easy on myself in a lot of ways and am in shock at having to do a li=
ttle bit of work for a change! I always go for the easy option haha. Hence =
why I don't want to have kids! I struggle looking after myself so I'm not s=
ure how I'd cope with another human to care for haha.
I'm sad to hear you've been unwell :(Take care and looking forward to seein=
g you very shortly :)
