Dear Mr Wang,

This is just a quick reminder to get your feedback in for the 2018
International Graduate Outcomes Survey (IGOS).

This link below will take you straight to the survey so that you can share
your experiences as an international graduate of an Australian university i=
n
the global job market.


http://survey.acer.edu.au/index.php?r=3Dsurvey/index/sid/324336/token/DIIXO=
uV_TKzy7p4/newtest/y

By sharing your post-study experiences you will be helping the Australian
Government and the university sector better understand the employability
outcomes of international students from your home country and improve educa=
tion
and training in Australia.

Thank you in advance for your contribution.
