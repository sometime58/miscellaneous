Dear Alberto=2CTravelling can seem very glamorous=2C but I can appreciate y=
ou saying that its financial aspects are not so appealing!In my dismal stat=
e of finances I can't afford to go much beyond Melbourne=2C but luckily the=
re's still so much left to explore. A lot of the fun of travelling to me is=
 not so much seeing new places but just the excuse to go for a walk haha. B=
ut all too often I wear myself out and spend the next day recovering!I've b=
een wandering around Melbourne quite a bit lately. I've had a good mixture =
of alone and company. I went on a day trip with Nathan to a shopping comple=
x frequented by the characters of Kath and Kim. And I went to Brighton beac=
h today with Izzy and got a bit sunburnt - it's easy to tell the places I m=
issed when putting on sunscreen!When I'm with others I'm sure I miss out on=
 a lot coz I'm thinking of talking to them and am fairly oblivious to the s=
urroundings. But when I'm by myself something is missing=2C so it's hard to=
 have it all haha.It's funny you mentioned personal hygiene. Yesterday I fo=
rgot to put on deodorant when I was out so I bought some from the supermark=
et haha. I'm not sure how good I am with mine. I usually shower every secon=
d day and do little more than put on deodorant and clean my teeth. Seems to=
 be good enough so far haha.Well done on getting through the three books! H=
ow did you find Harry Potter? Maybe the Wodehouse wasn't the best choice ha=
ha. A lot of the humour is the completely over the top (I guess academic) w=
ay of describing such farcical scenarios.Happy Spring Festival for two days=
 time. I saw it's going to be the year of the horse=2C which is my birthday=
 year as I'm going to be 24 this year. I still think of myself as about 16 =
haha.Exactly a month today until you're back! It's great timing as Wednesda=
y is the only day when I'm not at uni the whole day! When does your flight =
get in?It's a pity that my next semester is going to be so busy - I think I=
'm going to be in panic mode all the time. It will be a wonderful test of c=
haracter and organisation.I'm really keen about trying new food. I just hop=
e I can do it haha. I become a bit nauseous at just the thought of eating u=
nfamiliar foods so that will be another test! We mustn't forget about MDs h=
aha.I've been back in Melbourne for about a week now and it's been great. I=
've spent most of the time exploring. I'm going to have such trouble readju=
sting to uni haha. I've been doing a bit of songwriting and have discovered=
 that I always have the urge to write in the style of early Elton=2C which =
is essentially country music. I've been exploring that a tad and have becom=
e very keen of Dolly Parton all of a sudden. There's a chance you may like =
her voice if you like Taylor Swift.Take care and Happy Chinese new year! :)=
