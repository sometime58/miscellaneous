Dear Albert,

We've really missed you at SAIL! Are you still able to come every Saturday?

If not please let us know. If we don't see you for a few weeks we will need to take you off the list as a not current volunteer. 

Really hope to see you soon Albert!!!!!! 

Thank you

Smooth SAILing,
Nyssa Watson & Carlo Manley
