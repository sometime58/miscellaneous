Dear All Maidstone Volunteers,

This Saturday is our first SAIL for 2015. We are super excited to start!

We have some very important changes to SAIL policies and the way SAIL will
run this year. We are going to have a meeting with all volunteers before
SAIL tutoring this Saturday.

*This Saturday please arrive at 9am for the meeting in the main hall. *Drivers
will not need to drive families to SAIL beforehand as we will discuss this
in the meeting.

*It is crucial that all volunteers attend the meeting this Saturday at
9am. *

Thank you for letting us know if you will not be in attendance.

Smooth SAILing,
Nyssa Watson, Malang Deng, Alex Heath, Yoshi Inada-Lane & Carlo Manley
