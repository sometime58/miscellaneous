Dear Albert,

We just wanted to send a quick email about the starting date of SAIL 2015. 

We will recommence on the 21st of February. 

I'm sure all of you fabulous volunteers are looking forward to being back as much as we are! 

Please let us know if you have any changes to your commitments this year, either in terms of driving or general availability. 

We will also in touch about a few significant changes to SAIL (policies and structure) for this coming year. Please keep an eye out for this email which will be sent the week before we start back. 

Thank you for being such a magnificent team of tutors and volunteers. We can't wait to SAIL with you in 2015!

Smooth SAILing,
Nyssa Watson, Malang Deng, Alex Heath, Yoshi Inada-Lane & Carlo Manley
