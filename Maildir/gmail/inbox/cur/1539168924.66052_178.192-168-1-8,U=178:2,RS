Hi Albert,

Sorry to be a downer on Christmas Eve but I had to sort this all out before
I leave for Japan tonight!!!
I've paid the internet in advance so you guys won't be stuck in January
without it but it means it's a bigger total. No rush in getting the money
to me though.

Electricity - $89.15
Internet (Dec) - $27.40
Internet (Jan) - $27.40
Water - $10.27

Total:
$154.20

Hope you have a Merry Christmas and a happy new year!

I will be back on Jan 13th, hopefully there won't be any issues while I'm
away.

The rubbish bins are supposed to be put out tonight, but I'm not sure if
the council will be empty them tomorrow because it is a public holiday. If
the neighbours put them out, I will take ours out, but if not I will just
leave them until next week. If I do take them out I will send you a text
and if you could bring them in tomorrow that would be great.

Bye!
Sophie
