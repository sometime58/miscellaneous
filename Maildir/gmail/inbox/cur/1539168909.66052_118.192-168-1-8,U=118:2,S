Hi Maidstone Volunteers,

Firstly, we would like to say a big thank you to everyone for their
wonderful contributions to SAIL. This week is National Volunteer Week and
we would like to express how grateful we are to have such a dedicated and
enthusiastic bunch of volunteers at SAIL!

This Saturday we have a very important Tutor Talk and strongly encourage
all volunteers to attend. The overseeing coordinator, Lizzy Fitzgerald,
will be coming to speak about SAIL's Child Protection Policy. Included
below is the document for you to become familiar with:

 SAIL Program Child Protection
Policy.pdf<https://docs.google.com/a/sailprogram.org.au/file/d/0B7H7g9ipRSPESnVoRFFNcG84SE1LSHlwbTJDUHNoSTVpTFNv/edit?usp=drive_web>

The Tutor Talk will take place at Maidstone from about 12:30pm - 1pm, after
lunch and with enough time for drivers to take SAILors home and then return
for the talk.

Thank you for taking the time to familiarise yourself with SAIL's Child
Protection Policy. Please let us know if you are *not* able to attend the
Tutor Talk this Saturday.

Smooth SAILing,
Nyssa Watson, Malang Deng, Alex Heath and Yoshi Lane
