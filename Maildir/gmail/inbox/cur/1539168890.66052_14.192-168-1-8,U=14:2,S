ghtful and practical haha. It's good to have a clean notebook to take back =
home with me. I think my angst-filled pages is best kept safely in Melbourn=
e!Last time I went home for Christmas=2C I must have wanted a fresh start a=
nd through out the vast majority of my notebooks from before I moved to Mel=
bourne. I kinda regret it but it's no big deal. At least I won't be in such=
 a hurry to throw out my Melbourne ones now!
