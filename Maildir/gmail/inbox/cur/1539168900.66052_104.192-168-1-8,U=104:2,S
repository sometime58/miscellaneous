Dear Maidstone SAILors,

We would like to invite you to a very exciting tutor talk after SAIL this
Saturday at the SAIL Sunshine campus! It will be a fantastic talk from
Journalist Luke Hunt and a very exciting chance to meet fellow SAIL
volunteers from the Sunshine campus!

The tutor talk this Saturday will run from about 12:30pm to 1pm at the Visy
Cares Hub in Sunshine, 80b Harvester Road, Sunshine 3020.

Journalist Luke Hunt will be visiting us to discuss international conflict
zones around the world, in what is sure to be an informative and
interesting talk.

*Luke Hunt is a Southeast Asia correspondent for the New York Times and The
Economist, specialising in regional security and economic policy issues. He
has worked in journalism for more than 25 years. Professor Hunt has served
as bureau chief for Agence-France Presse (AFP) in Cambodia, and in
Afghanistan during the Taliban occupation, where he was commended by the
United Nations for the "best and most insightful" coverage of the Afghan
civil war. He also covered the Iraq war in 2003 and was the first foreign
journalist to enter Baghdad with U.S. troops after the fall of Saddam
Hussein.*


For those tutors who undertake the most important task of driving SAILors
home each week, we will be making sure that there is plenty of time for you
to return, before we get underway.

We are looking forward to seeing you all there as a wonderful chance to get
to know fellow volunteers at SAIL and to hear this inspirational talk.

Smooth SAILing,
Nyssa Watson, Malang Deng and Alex Heath
Coordinators (Footscray campus)
