Hi Alberto=2C
=20
I'm leaving Port in an hour and I won't have access to a computer till Wedn=
esday=2C so I'll write a decent response then.

I'm very thrilled to hear about your success in the competition. Congratula=
tions! It must be an amazing feeling!

Talk soon!

Dear=0A=
Lach=2C=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
It=92s=0A=
been nice hearing from you as always. I=92m so glad you=92ve enjoyed time a=
nd=0A=
company with your family and helping with the housework. Honestly speaking =
I=92m=0A=
the type of guy who enjoys so much in parenting. You see=2C kids are always=
=0A=
changing throughout their development. And as a developmental psychology=0A=
student you=92ll find amazing how those shifts work and what they mean to b=
ecome=0A=
into a certain phase of life. So parenting means so much in a child=92s lif=
e and=0A=
is a great part of how their values are formed towards things. And also=2C =
housekeeping=0A=
skills is a big part of life. You have to familiarise yourself with all asp=
ects=0A=
of what life can be like and be ready for challenges always. Supply kids wi=
th=0A=
all sorts of resources they need can be a hard task. During almost all peri=
ods=0A=
of a child=92s life=2C especially the adolescence=2C what they need emotion=
ally=0A=
always will come first before the physical requirements. Some psychologists=
=0A=
even say that teaching is conditioning=2C so all kinds of influence will=0A=
certainly have impact upon the modes of one=92s behaviour later in time. =
=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
By=0A=
the way I=92ve finally pinned down my subjects two days ago. I=92ve been go=
ing back=0A=
and forth on which to decide between philosophy and media as I want to do=
=0A=
double majors. The result is I chose the latter. Apparently cultural study =
is=0A=
more interesting to be doing and also this way many pieces of articles abou=
t=0A=
people=92s behaviour will be involved in the course whereas if choosing=0A=
philosophy=2C all we will read will be great works from well-known philosop=
hers=0A=
about pure strands of thoughts in their mind. But after all I=92ll keep on=
=0A=
reading philosophy. That way all the questions and confusion in my head abo=
ut=0A=
life can in some way be responded to and hopefully one day I can get over w=
ith.=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
I=0A=
think I understand your uncle who moved to England for more than ten years =
but=0A=
still contains this attachment to the coastal scenery and the land where he=
 was=0A=
originally born. Going overseas to me is no foreign notion but still feels =
so=0A=
unique. Change of place of living can totally change the idea of a place fr=
om=0A=
what you=92ve expected. There can be so many things out of your anticipatio=
n=2C=0A=
whether good or bad=2C and you learn from what you experience as well as th=
e=0A=
great gap between the imagination and reality. Actually when I first got to=
 Australia=2C=0A=
I didn=92t expect much. I think I even imagined for the worst coming up. Yo=
u know=2C=0A=
a guy in a new country=2C different people=2C different views. And I really=
 had a=0A=
hard time understanding the accent=2C by the way=2C still do. I still remem=
ber the=0A=
first time I came out of the room for security check and went to the counte=
r=0A=
for where I can take a taxi as I don=92t know anything about the public tra=
nsport=0A=
routes=2C and the woman in the counter smiled really sweat to me but said=
=0A=
something that I almost was sure what was definitely another language=2C I =
got=0A=
stunned and=2C hate to admit but=2C rather petrified. I guess the first imp=
ression=0A=
of Australia to me didn=92t do its justice that at that moment I was almost=
 one=0A=
hundred percent sure the at least next three years here shall be miserable =
and lonely.=0A=
Living in another country is so different and it makes you learn a lot more=
=0A=
than you=92ll ever expect. On this part I may be able to sympathise with yo=
ur uncle=0A=
and therefore admire him for doing that over a decade. =0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
I=0A=
hope going back to Melbourne can be real fun to you. What do you plan to do=
=0A=
before the teaching begins? Eating a lot of Mds? Bathing yourself in the se=
a of=0A=
philosophy? Writing small comments about anything you come across in life? =
Hope=0A=
you have the best return and enjoy your journey.=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
And=0A=
also you are the first one I=92m telling you about this besides my parents.=
 I=92m=0A=
so eager now to share this with you since your appreciation is so much=0A=
important to me. I=92ve won an award in a kind of a literature writing cont=
est! It=92s=0A=
not even the first time me winning any prize in writing but this time it=92=
s=0A=
somehow different. This one is big and is always the kind of award I=92m lo=
ng=0A=
for. It honours those who write seriously and with great passion in literat=
ure=0A=
as well as writing. It was the third race I won so it wasn=92t that big as =
hell=0A=
but great deal to me after all. I=92m asked to give a speech as I=92m the y=
oungest=0A=
winner this year and I am willing to do so. I=92m always not a fan of expre=
ssing=0A=
my point of views in a public scene but this time I feel=2C stronger than e=
ver=2C=0A=
that I should stand up to give a speech. I have to say something for those =
who=0A=
are like me in their 20s=2C young and enthusiastic=2C and still believe in =
writing=2C=0A=
the kind of difference one can make using their pens and paper in this day =
and=0A=
age. I want to=2C at least=2C represent a group of people who are still str=
iving=0A=
for expression and compassion with their words in mind and skills in puttin=
g them=0A=
together. This is like the biggest achievement I=92ve ever made in writing=
=2C and I=0A=
appreciate it so much. I hope you can feel happy for me as now talking abou=
t=0A=
it=2C I can=92t even stop my typing fingers from shaking. =0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
This=0A=
is not the first time I talk about literature with you. Whenever it comes t=
o=0A=
this topic I can=92t help getting depressed. I think modern technologies an=
d the=0A=
fast style of life are stifling literature. the way of communication nowada=
ys=0A=
is draining people of their creativity and literature is dying slowly with =
the=0A=
progress made in media and lessened time spent in reading. The story I sent=
 for=0A=
contest was actually the story I wrote when I was in high school but sent a=
fter=0A=
some small adjustments. It was about the story happened with me and a group=
 of=0A=
friends. We used to form up a literature group and talk about writing and=
=0A=
writers. There were more than twenty of us from countries all over the glob=
e. I=0A=
got to meet one of them when my family travelled to Spain to see my aunt li=
ving=0A=
over there. Penzi is the name of him=2C who later introduced me into the gr=
oup=0A=
and to one who was the person in my story=2C Carl. Carl died in his 28=2C 2=
2 May=2C=0A=
2010. I wrote this story to commemorate him after I got the phone call from=
=0A=
Penzi that Carl had passed away in his apartment. He used drugs to keep him=
=0A=
working 24/7. He started this newspaper where he published things written b=
y himself=0A=
as well as his friends.=0A=
=0A=
I=0A=
think we came together out of desperation and belief we all have upon=0A=
literature. the big dreams of ours and we thought we couldn't give it up=0A=
without a fight. After Carl=92s death=2C we kind of drifted apart with only=
 occasional=0A=
and infrequent contact given that the core of this group is absent forever.=
 =0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
Now=0A=
I come to think about dreams. The greatest dreams one can ever have in time=
 of=0A=
their lives which not only involve themselves but also people of contempora=
ry and=0A=
the past. Those dreams are mostly long gone without people mentioning them=
=0A=
anymore=2C like literature=2C and so many things alike. I don=92t even know=
 now=0A=
whether it=92s good or bad anymore. sometimes I just think with deep regret=
=2C but=0A=
somehow having to=2C that perhaps oblivion is the best answer for most of t=
he=0A=
questions of this kind. =0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
I=92m=0A=
sorry if the content of my letter brings you down. I don=92t usually get so=
=0A=
serious with others like this. And by the way=2C this is how when I=92m rea=
lly=0A=
serious is like haha. Always with a mood of depression and deep confusion. =
=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
Hope=0A=
everything is going well and always will be. =0A=
=0A=
Missing=0A=
you=0A=
