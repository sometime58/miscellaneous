Hi Abby and Albert!

I have just heard about your Chinese language classes at Melbourne law schoo=
l on wed nights! It's a shame I only found out about it now and missed out o=
n 5 weeks.

Was wondering if it's too late to join in the last few classes-starting tomo=
rrow night?=20

Will have a look at the material online.=20

Thanks!

Kind regards,
