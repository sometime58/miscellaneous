Dear Albert,

Next week, November 8th, after SAIL, we are holding a Tutor Talk presented by Child Wise. Child Wise is one of Australia's leading not-for-profit child abuse prevention programs. 

There is usually a price attached to this training session, so we are very fortunate to have access to it for free! You will receive a certificate of completion at the end of the session.

The presentation will run from 12:30pm - 2:30pm after SAIL. We think the 2-hour time commitment will be well and truly worth it. 

The session will take place at the Sunshine SAIL campus, alongside their volunteers. The address of the campus is 80b Harvester Road, Visy Cares Hub, Sunshine. It will be a great opportunity for Sunshine and Maidstone SAILors to get to know each other! 

On this day we will be packing up the campus early and serving lunch at 11:30am. This will give all drivers the chance to take SAILors home before the session. 

Thank you for your extraordinary commitment to SAIL, we are thrilled to have such a wonderful volunteer team!

Smooth SAILing,
Nyssa Watson, Malang Deng, Alex Heath & Yoshi Inada-Lane
Coordinators (Footscray campus)
