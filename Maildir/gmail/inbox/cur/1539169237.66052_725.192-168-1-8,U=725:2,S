Hi Aohan,

1. Yes - you need to keep a copy of the observations notes each time =
your MT (or another teacher) observes you. There is a template for MTs =
to use to record their observations of your teaching. It's in the back =
of the handbook. It=E2=80=99s the same as the one we used in our very =
first seminar together on campus.

Some MT=E2=80=99s prefer to handwrite their notes - not ideal but fine! =
If this is the case, they should attempt to observe using the same =
layout as the template. You should then scan/take a photo and upload it =
to your ePortfolio on Google Drive.

There is also a LOG that you should be completing with the dates and =
subjects  and details of lessons that YOU observe and YOU teach. This is =
how we account for the number of hours teaching/observing that you need =
to do. This is on the LMS/handbook.

2. While the lessons will be similar in focus, they should differ in =
delivery and pacing based on student needs. No two lessons will ever be =
the same - although some experienced teachers plan the same thing twice =
but deliver differently based on their own knowledge of the class - so =
it can sometimes feel that it=E2=80=99s the same lesson when you are =
watching.  Ask your MT what might need to change for the second lesson. =
You will need to write two different lesson plans for the lessons to =
count it as 2 lessons (90 + 90). Take into account the prior activities =
and knowledge of each class to make them different.

By the way - it=E2=80=99s never a bother to email me with questions. Ask =
any time. And of course I know who you are :0)

I hope tomorrow goes well - email again if you need, or ask Anna at St =
Columba=E2=80=99s if that=E2=80=99s easier.

Regards,

Jo
