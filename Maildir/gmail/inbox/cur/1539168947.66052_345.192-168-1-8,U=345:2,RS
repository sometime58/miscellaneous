Dear Albert,

Hi how are you? I hope your exams went well.
I just would like to know whether the next semester's Chinese class will
also be on every Wednesday night or not, since I'm registering to my
classes for the next semester and I'll have to adjust my Wed evening class
accordingly.

Thank you in advance, Albert
Best regards,
Frans
