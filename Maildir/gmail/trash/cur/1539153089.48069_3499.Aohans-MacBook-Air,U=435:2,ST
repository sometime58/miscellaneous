Dear=C2=A0Mr Wang,

Did you know more than 800,000 international students studied in Australia
last year?

Amazing right? But where are they now?

We are looking for international alumni from The University of Melbourne to
share their experiences since graduating with an Australian degree.

To have your say click on the following link to the 2018 International
Graduate Outcomes Survey (IGOS):


http://survey.acer.edu.au/index.php?r=3Dsurvey/index/sid/324336/token/DIIXO=
uV_TKzy7p4/newtest/y

By participating in the survey you will be providing the Australian
Government and the university sector with valuable information about the
diverse career paths international students take after completing their stu=
dies
in Australia.

Thank you in advance for your contribution.
