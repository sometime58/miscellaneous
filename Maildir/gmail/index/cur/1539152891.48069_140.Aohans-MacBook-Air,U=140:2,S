Dear Albert,

According to our records, your first time SAILing was exactly one year ago this week!! We just wanted to send through an email to offer our sincere thanks to you for making such a sustained and steady contribution to the SAIL world. 

The long-term SAILors, like yourself, are the building blocks both for strong relationships within SAIL but also for us, as co-ordinators, who come to rely on you as a guiding light for the newer SAILors who are constantly joining us.

Thank you sincerely for your generous donation of time and energy over the last 12 months to the Sudanese and SAIL communities. Long may it continue!

Smooth SAILing,
Nyssa Watson, Malang Deng and Alex Heath
Coordinators (Footscray campus)
