Dear Albert,

Saturday 4 October will mark 13 years since the SAIL Program began.

We will be celebrating this from 11am to 1:15pm at the Footscray Community Arts Centre, 45 Moreland Street, Footscray. 
 
The day will bring together SAIL's four Melbourne campuses, feature speeches and performances by SAIL students from across the SAIL world, as well as a birthday cake, party food, activities and the opportunity to reflect on 13 years of SAILing!

SAIL volunteers and students will be travelling by car/public transport to Footscray Community Arts Centre. If you do not usually drive any students to SAIL, please make your own way to the Arts Centre. If you do usually drive SAILors, we hope you will be willing to bring a car load of students with you to the birthday. Please make sure you arrive at the centre by 11am, when the festivities will begin. Please note that the birthday celebrations will conclude by 1.15pm. 

For cake bakers, your culinary contribution would be especially welcome at this celebration. Please bring them with you. We are also looking for volunteers to help run a face-painting stall on the day, and to help supervise the perimeter of the birthday venue. If you would be willing to take on one of these roles, please let us know. 

Thanks for being part of SAIL as we mark this special birthday! 

Smooth SAILing,
Nyssa Watson, Malang Deng, Alex Heath and Yoshi Inada-Lane
