Dear Albert,

We have some very exciting news: we are successful recipients of a grant from Mt Buller Ski Lifts and will be able to run a SAIL ski camp this year! 

We are currently looking for a few volunteers to help run the camp. We need volunteers who can ski (reasonably well), drive a carload of SAILors and can make themselves available on the weekend of Friday the 19th of September to Monday the 22nd of September. If you happen to tick all of those boxes and would like to come on the SAIL camp of a lifetime please let Nyssa know ASAP! 

Please also keep this a secret from SAIL students as there are unfortunately limited places and not everyone will be able to attend the camp. 

Thanks! 

Smooth SAILing,
Nyssa Watson, Malang Deng, Alex Heath and Yoshi Inada-Lane
