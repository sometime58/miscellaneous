Thanks Sophie,

I'm happy to stay with Optus as I know that doing the change over can be a r=
eal pain. I'd also rather not pay the transfer fee. Having said this it woul=
d be good to get some kind of guarantee as to the speed and overall quality o=
f connection if they offer one, and also ask if there is any way to improve t=
he connection maybe? What do you think, cheers Tom
