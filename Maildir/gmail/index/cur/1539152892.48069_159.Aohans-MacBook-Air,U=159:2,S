Hey LINGsters!

Hope everything is going well, and hope that the assignment blues aren't
getting to you. To alleviate your suffering, this Tuesday we will be
playing some fun language-related games; Taboo, which is a word guessing
game, Pictionary, which is also a word guessing game (involves drawing),
and Scrabble, the famous tile-based game. Snacks and hot drinks will be
provided!

When?            Tuesday
Where?           TBA (room pending/ south lawn)
Time?              12 pm - 1 pm

So if you're looking to improve your vocabulary, or just to have a great
time, come by and meet other people who love language and linguistics!
Don't forget to bring your friends.

See you on Tuesday!

Wan Nee
Vice President and Secretary
L.I.N.G Club
