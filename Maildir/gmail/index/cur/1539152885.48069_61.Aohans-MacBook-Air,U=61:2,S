Hope you are feeling relaxed and chilled now. I find sometimes when I feel =
upset myself in need of meditation and some alone time to think through thi=
ngs. You'll have to go to uni tomorrow and so do I. So I think a good night=
 sleep can help a lot. Things will get past. Cheer up!=0A=

Kiss good night and sweet dreamsAlbert

So I'll let you take a nap and relax. :-)=0A=
