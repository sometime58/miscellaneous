Dear Albert,

We would like to let you know of an exciting opportunity for SAIL volunteers. Teach for Australia, a not-for-profit organisation that works to combat the problem of educational disadvantage in Australia, will be running a professional development session specifically for SAIL volunteers on Wednesday, 2nd April, from 5pm-7pm. 

This session will be specifically tailored towards skills that you need as a SAIL volunteer in order to make the most of your time with your student/s. Topics covered will include how to plan an effective SAIL lesson, and how to respond to the needs of students with low literacy and/or English as an additional language. 

We would strongly encourage you to put the date in your diary, as this is an invaluable opportunity to expand your skills as a tutor. You can RSVP to the session at the following link: 

https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/leadership-lesson-planning-eal-diagnostics-and-more-registration-10868039599

We very much hope to see you there!

Teach for Australia’s award-winning leadership program affords an accelerated two years of unprecedented personal growth and a Masters level of professional training. Meet an alumnus at the TFA Employer presentation and ask why Australia's most outstanding young leaders are choosing the Associate experience to rapidly advance their careers and make an impact on educational inequity. You can also book a ‘Coffee on Campus’ to chat in greater depth about exactly what’s involved and the application process.
