Dear Albert=2C=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
Before I forget=2C I=92d like to wish you a very happy 21st=0A=
birthday for Thursday. It=92s not as though you=92d be sick of alcohol by n=
ow=2C so=0A=
what a lovely excuse to indulge in more liquor! That was supposed to be the=
=0A=
biggest birthday=2C though little did I know it that my 22nd birthday would=
=0A=
be when my life changed forever =96 when I became eligible for welfare!=0A=
=0A=
You never know with admin=2C but it looks like my course is=0A=
all sorted for next year. So I have a bit more piece of mind for now! It lo=
oks=0A=
like I=92ll be going home from Thursday onwards. I still haven=92t stumbled=
 across=0A=
your well-hidden Christmas gifts=2C so feel free to send back a quick email=
=0A=
before Thursday disclosing their whereabouts!=0A=
=0A=
It was funny reading your paragraph about battery. Chris=2C as=0A=
far as I=92m aware=2C hasn=92t been angry with Mari in recent times. Their=
=0A=
relationship has just been a little strained. It=92s been me that has snapp=
ed! It=0A=
happened the day after I sent the last message. I started doing the vacuumi=
ng=0A=
but couldn=92t complete it and Mari took that as an opportunity to do her s=
cales=0A=
practice. I wanted to do some writing in my room and found that I just coul=
dn=92t=0A=
concentrate=2C which was really annoying and worked me up a bit. I decided =
to go=0A=
into the kitchen to calm down and this is where I made my fatal error. I=0A=
successfully walked past the piano room only to find that a moment later on=
 an=0A=
unpremeditated impulse=2C I was standing before Mari=2C my body shaking=2C =
my voice=0A=
shaking=2C expressing that I found her practising annoying (which to me was=
 a=0A=
judicious understatement!)=0A=
=0A=
She will be the only person in Melbourne who will be able to=0A=
get a firsthand account as to what Lachlan looks like when he loses it. It=
=92s a=0A=
funny thing. You just can=92t stop shaking.=0A=
=0A=
I don=92t regret it too much as at least people know the=0A=
effect they have on you. Better letting it out and forever fostering silent=
=0A=
resentment. Things aren=92t the same=2C but it doesn=92t bother me. I guess=
 anger=92s=0A=
only bad if you really value the other person=92s friendship. And that=92s =
as much=0A=
as I will put in writing =96 I don=92t want to have too much of an electron=
ic=0A=
record about how much of a bitch I am! I=92ll only say that it=92s hard as =
I feel=0A=
very empathetic to her=2C but empathy doesn=92t necessarily neutralise anno=
yance!=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
You will have to enjoy this letter as a rare exception to my=0A=
usually angst-plagued writing. Getting the course sorted out=2C staying on =
Youth=0A=
Allowance=2C going home soon=2C all do wonders for peace of mind. I=92m sur=
e I would=0A=
have alluded to one=92s worldview as being a process of constructing and=0A=
inevitable crumbling and constructing and so on. I feel my outlook quite=0A=
settled for the moment and will make the most of it while it lasts! Hopeful=
ly=0A=
one day all this angst of relative youth will be locked away with the key=
=0A=
destroyed!=0A=
=0A=
It=92s always what you don=92t do that matters. I think I=92ve=0A=
asked enough questions lately and chased my tail enough that I will stop as=
king=0A=
them for the moment and choose to settle. At the moment=2C the principal qu=
estion=0A=
is how best can I occupy my day? Things always seem worthwhile and meaningf=
ul=0A=
if you can justify them. It seems that if you can keep yourself occupied fr=
om=0A=
waking to sleeping on =91meaningful=92 things you enjoy then a lot of life =
sorts=0A=
itself out. That is=2C if you=92re lucky enough to be able to do that and n=
ot be=0A=
caught in the many traps lurking about that cause people to be slaves to th=
eir=0A=
desire.=0A=
=0A=
It is nice to fully appreciate that life doesn=92t always have=0A=
to be exciting all the time. I remember Russel saying that to be somewhat=
=0A=
=91happy=92 we must have great tolerance for boredom. Not that boredom has =
any=0A=
place in our culture of excitement and enthusiasm! I think this is the best=
=0A=
thing about getting older. At school I always wished I was the energetic=2C=
=0A=
adventurous=2C involved person and would always feel inadequate. Now I rath=
er=0A=
enjoy being a low-energy cautious grandmother. For one thing=2C it=92s real=
ly quite=0A=
easy and fairly stress-free! Although I readily admit that being young is n=
ot easy=2C=0A=
especially if you haven=92t found a way of earning an income which you enjo=
y.=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
I think that deep down a lot of people don=92t wish to be=0A=
stressed. It seems that a powerful motivator for a lot of actions is approv=
al.=0A=
Or=2C in my pessimistic slant on things(!)=2C avoiding embarrassment. It is=
 lucky=0A=
that we have this emotion otherwise trouble would be everywhere=2C however=
=0A=
sometimes we can go a bit overboard. I=92ve become quite aware lately of th=
e hold=0A=
that my acute fear of embarrassment has on my life. Though I=92m sure that =
this=0A=
caution has kept me out of trouble!=0A=
=0A=
Yes=2C you hear the same story over and over=2C about success=0A=
and money not buying fulfilment=2C but the need for approval and status is =
so=0A=
powerfully wired in us. Plus=2C as I was saying last time=2C I=92m sure it=
=92s just a=0A=
way of keeping people occupied.=0A=
=0A=
I have been aware lately that if people require me to prove=0A=
myself to be their friend=2C then I have no desire of their friendship=0A=
whatsoever.=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
Now onto daily trivial matters. I haven=92t been very social=0A=
lately. I met a friend at the art gallery because I wanted to walk in the=
=0A=
Botanic Gardens. That probably wasn=92t the best place to choose to meet as=
 she=0A=
assumed I wanted to look in the gallery! It was fine though. There was a bi=
g=0A=
exhibition of contemporary art=2C which was quite interesting=2C as those=
=0A=
exhibitions are always full of surprises! Random is quite a pertinent word=
=2C=0A=
though I think they=92d skin you alive if you described their work as such!=
 =0A=
=0A=
I=92ve got this excellent teach-yourself German book. It=92s an=0A=
awesome feeling to feel like a may be getting somewhere after all these yea=
rs=0A=
of trying. As I may have said before=2C it=92s nice to know that all these =
failed=0A=
attempts may one day steer me in the right direction! I=92ve been listening=
 to=0A=
Disney songs to help me learn and have become quite sentimental about my=0A=
childhood! It=92s so cool revisiting pleasant childhood memories.=0A=
=0A=
I=92ve also been reading the book I got for you =96 The Code of=0A=
the Woosters. I=92ve got less than 20 pages to go. It=92s been enjoyable as=
 always!=0A=
I would love to be able to write like him! I would love my world to be as l=
ight=0A=
and warm as his=2C though there=92s far too much drama! =0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
I=92m fairly tired at the moment =96 who would have guessed!=0A=
Walking in the rain this morning really took it out of me. I had two long n=
aps=0A=
but I don=92t think they were enough! I=92m meeting my step-sister at the=
=0A=
children=92s hospital to give her her present. It=92s so tempting to have M=
Ds but=0A=
I=92ve got a lot of food to get through before I go back to Wagga!=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
Have a good few days and happy birthday!!!!=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
X=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
Lach=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
P.S. I=92m so curious and hungry(?) to discover your presents!=0A=
Feel free to let me know their whereabouts as you know that I have great tr=
ouble=0A=
delaying my gratification haha.=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
Missing you!
I think the exclamation mark is fading on my keyboard!!!=0A=

lately. I met a friend at the art gallery because I wanted to walk in the=
=0A=
Botanic Gardens. That probably wasn=92t the best place to choose to meet as=
 she=0A=
assumed I wanted to look in the gallery! It was fine though. There was a bi=
g=0A=
exhibition of contemporary art=2C which was quite interesting=2C as those=
=0A=
exhibitions are always full of surprises! Random is quite a pertinent word=
=2C=0A=
though I think they=92d skin you alive if you described their work as such!=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">I=92ve got this excellent teach-yourself German book=
. It=92s an=0A=
awesome feeling to feel like a may be getting somewhere after all these yea=
rs=0A=
of trying. As I may have said before=2C it=92s nice to know that all these =
failed=0A=
attempts may one day steer me in the right direction! I=92ve been listening=
 to=0A=
Disney songs to help me learn and have become quite sentimental about my=0A=
childhood! It=92s so cool revisiting pleasant childhood memories.<o:p></o:p=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">I=92ve also been reading the book I got for you =96 =
The Code of=0A=
the Woosters. I=92ve got less than 20 pages to go. It=92s been enjoyable as=
 always!=0A=
I would love to be able to write like him! I would love my world to be as l=

Walking in the rain this morning really took it out of me. I had two long n=

but I don=92t think they were enough! I=92m meeting my step-sister at the=
