Dear Albert,

I just wanted to let you all know that I'm going to be away until the 18th of July. Lucky for me, I'm going on a holiday to Western Australia and the Northern Territory, where it's warm!

Carlo will be SAILing solo over this time, so it would be great if you are able to help him out in anyway with things like setting up and cleaning up, transport for families and helping out and/or collecting the lunch from the Sunshine campus. Just let Carlo know if you are able to be of extra assistance! :)

Thank you for being wonderful volunteers, I'll miss you all while I'm away! 

Have a great time SAILing!!
Nyssa
