Dear Albert,

Happy New Year!

The SAIL Program sets sail for 2014 on Saturday 22 February at 10.30am at the usual location. We hope you will join us again!  If you are not able to make it to the first week or weeks after it, please let us know via the can't come form at http://www.sailprogram.org.au/Pulse/really.php?option=Dandenong%20Robinson

By way of confirmation, if you were collecting SAILors from their homes at the end of last year, please do so again on the first day back at 10:00am. There may be families who have moved house over summer so, if you go to the usual address to find that the usual people are not there, please just let us know. This year we are making major changes to the way we cater to secondary students so if the house you collect from has teenagers, please especially encourage them to come along. 

On another note, you may be aware of the escalation of conflict and resulting food shortage in South Sudan over the summer break. Most SAIL families are likely to be impacted by this with family at risk or relatives or friends possibly having died in South Sudan. We encourage you to be sensitive to these issues and to be available to provide support to students if appropriate. For the latest information on South Sudan, we recommend the following resources: 
•	AllAfrica.com: http://allafrica.com/southsudan
•	BBC world service: http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldserviceradio
•	Daily podcast from the Voice of America, ‘South Sudan in Focus’ – http://www.voanews.com/archive/south-sudan-in-focus/latest/706/1465.html

A former SAILor, Gatwech Puoch, is now a senior member of the South Sudanese government. Gatwech has contacted us to ask for any financial assistance SAILors can offer to help to purchase food and medicine for his constituents, the people of Malakal, Upper Nile, from Kenya. We know him well and trust him to keep his word. To minimise the impact of the international transaction fee, if you would like to contribute to the funds we send, please let me know how much you are willing to donate and I will send you the bank account to which the funds can be sent. Former SAILors have already committed $1250. We hope we can increase this. 

We look forward to seeing you on Saturday 22 February at 10.30am. Thanks in anticipation of your return!

Smooth SAILing,
Nyssa Watson, Malang Deng and Alex Heath
