Dear Albert,

This week we have some exciting news - we have 30 people signed up to attend the induction tour at Maidstone!

After the tour we hope to pair these new volunteers with a tutor 'buddy' who will be able to guide them and provide additional support for their first weeks SAILing. The volunteers will be placed according to which SAIL mini program they have selected: SAIL Juniors, Primary, Secondary or Senior.  Being a buddy tutor will require you to alter the last 15 minutes of your session to accommodate the new tutor into your lesson. Therefore, we would like to ask if you would feel comfortable in this role and are happy for us to pair you with one of the new volunteers. We will also come around on Saturday and ask all student SAILors if they are happy with this arrangement as well. Please let us know via email today or tomorrow when you arrive. 

Thank you for your support of new SAIL volunteers! 

Smooth SAILing,
Nyssa Watson, Malang Deng and Alex Heath
