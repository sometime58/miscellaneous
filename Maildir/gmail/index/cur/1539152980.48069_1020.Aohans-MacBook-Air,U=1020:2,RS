Hi Albert,
I'm good and currently spending a couple of days here in Amsterdam. I don't u=
nderstand why the account needs to be cancelled. It's just a transfer of acc=
ount that needs to be done. It's just a matter of changing the account detai=
ls to yours. They are being stupid. There should be no need for me to call t=
hem. Tell them I am out of Australia now so they should sort something out f=
or you. If they can't help you then might be better to switch to another pro=
vider. Much simpler process I reckon. Let me know how it goes with them. Tha=
nks.
