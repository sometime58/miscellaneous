Hi Aohan,

I love how much work you put into it. It looks great.

The fun-to-know things are good. It helps keep it light, interesting and
useful.

It is long but that shouldn't be an issue, some people like a long one. It
can make it tempting to rush through content before people understand it
though. As long as you avoid rushing it, it should be good.

Keep it up :)

Cheers,

Adam
