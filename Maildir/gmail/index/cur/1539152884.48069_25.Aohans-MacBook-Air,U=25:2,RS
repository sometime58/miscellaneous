Hi Albert,
Hope you had a merry Christmas and a happy new year and are enjoying being
back at home in China. Just thought I'd let you know so as not to shock you
that there have been a couple of bills come in. The first one is the water
bill which actually arrived before you left so you might recall seeing it
on the table. Your share is $52. We also had an electricity bill of which
your share is $115.60. So the total so far is $167.60. Please don't feel
you need to pay them immediately, I just thought it would be a good idea to
let you know because it can be hard returning to study with all the
expenses for the year up front, and then to have all these bills on top of
that as well. I have stuck the bills up on the pinboard if you wish to
check them out when you return.
We're having some problem with the internet but hopefully it will be fixed
before you return. You are obviously not paying for the internet while you
are gone, just thought I'd tell you in case it's still not working when you
get back but that is quite unlikely.
Hope you're well, it's strange not having you around!
Sophie
