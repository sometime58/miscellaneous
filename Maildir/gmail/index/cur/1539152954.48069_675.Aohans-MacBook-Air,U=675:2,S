Hi Abby, Aohan, Kaixi, Nora, Yifan and Yiyue,

Thank you all for responding and saying that you will continue teaching
this semester.

I'm still waiting for a response from the other teachers and I have
advertised on Facebook to get new teachers. If you have any friends that
might be interested, please get them to email me to apply.

To best meet everyone's preferences, I think this structure would be best:

1. Beginner: Aohan and Nora
2. Post-Beginner: Abby and Yiyue
3. Intermediate: Kaixi + need 1 more
4. Post-Intermediate: need 2
5. Advanced: Yifan + need 1 more

Seeing that we'll start classes in week 2 this year (Tuesday 8th March,
6:30pm) please start to think about topics for the semester and feel free
to start your class preparation for the first week. Please try to email me
any class materials by Saturday 11:59pm before each class.

Our beginning of semester meet-up will be Tuesday 1st March 6:30pm in room
533 of the law school. Please let me know if you can or cannot attend.

This year we want to attract more law students and lawyers so it would be
great if you could teach some law/business related topics, although I
realise this is difficult with the lower levels. I'll leave it up to you to
decide how much (if any) law-related content you want to add.

One other change this year is we would like to create teacher profiles. Can
you please write and email to me 3-5 sentences about yourself (e.g. where
in China you're from, what you're studying, hobbies etc.)? Also, I think it
would be good to have a photo for each profile, so it would be great if you
could send a photo as well.

Quick summary - things to do:
1. Get your friends to apply to be teachers (if you know anyone who might
be interested).
2. Let me know if you can/cannot attend next Tuesday's meet-up.
3. List of topics for the semester.
4. Short profile about yourself.
5. Class materials for the first class.

Thanks again for getting involved again this year.

Best regards,


*Adam Spottiswood*
