Hi Albert=2C=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
You never need to apologise for complaining=2C because there=92s=0A=
an exceptionally high likelihood that I=92ll do the same in the next letter=
. And=0A=
I feel today is one such day!=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
As I said previously=2C some days I view my life as wonderful=0A=
and feel so lucky how everything has turned out. However I only need to twe=
ak=0A=
my perspective and suddenly everything looks the opposite. I find it=92s li=
ke=0A=
viewing nature=2C take birds for instance. You can see them as flying about=
=2C=0A=
free=2C enjoying being alive. Or you can see them as constantly being haunt=
ed by=0A=
hunger and predators and moving out of anxious necessity just to keep the p=
ain=0A=
at bay. And so it goes=2C these valiant attempts to quell pain only to see =
it=0A=
rear its head again a short time later.=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
I=92ll start with a few everyday things before I start to vent=0A=
my frustration at existence! I=92ll just say that I feel venting frustratio=
n is=0A=
an excellent exercise in self purification. Hopefully releasing anger helps=
 to=0A=
get rid of it=2C rather than stirring it up!=0A=
=0A=
Firstly=2C don=92t feel obliged to read those books straight=0A=
away! They have personal meaning to me and I=92m really pleased to give you=
 the=0A=
opportunity to try them. But if they=92re not your thing=2C don=92t feel ob=
liged to=0A=
read them just to get me off your back haha.=0A=
=0A=
That was a really sweet idea about hiding the gifts. I just=0A=
hope the others haven=92t found them for themselves! It=92s good you can ma=
ke=0A=
surprises last. I=92m usually impatient for people to open my gifts. Maybe =
the=0A=
suspense just gets to me too much! It=92s most likely that universal trait =
=96 to=0A=
want everything NOW. In the modern world people have the ability to get the=
ir=0A=
desires so easily. Life seems one big quest to squeeze in as much pleasure =
into=0A=
as little time as possible. No wonder the world is on fast forward!=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
Alright=2C back to doom=2C gloom and disillusionment. =0A=
=0A=
I have referred to my recent interest in Watts and Russell=0A=
but before this I remember having a brief phase when I was interested in th=
e=0A=
work of Albert Camus and to a lesser existent other existential philosopher=
s of=0A=
that era.=0A=
=0A=
I=92m sure it=92s no surprise to you that the overwhelming=0A=
pessimism on which the philosophy of Absurdism is founded resonates deeply =
with=0A=
me! Pessimism and existential nihilism seem the most basic and obvious ways=
 to=0A=
look at life. However it is not practically useful at all as it advises us =
to=0A=
create our own meaning within the meaninglessness=2C which is no easy feat.=
=0A=
=0A=
This is why the concept of value is so interesting to me. If=0A=
you start from the premise that everything is meaningless and valueless=2C =
then=0A=
it is very interesting to see the way that humans manipulate things to give=
=0A=
them value! Striving towards a valued goal gives people a sense of purpose.=
=0A=
Happiness comes to those who are most able to disillusion themselves! How=
=0A=
wonderful it must feel to be on a mission towards what you value.=0A=
=0A=
Watts spoke a little bit about the world as a drama =96 he=0A=
called it the game of white verse black. To take an example=2C there are so=
me=0A=
people who gain meaning in their lives through success and earning a profit=
.=0A=
These people will be avid to clear forests to suit their business interests=
 (and=0A=
the economic interest of society as a whole). Then there will be people who=
=0A=
gain meaning in their lives by protecting nature and conserving endangered=
=0A=
species. They will do all they can to ensure they stop the logging. So it=
=92s a=0A=
constant battle between these two groups. They=92re both occupied=2C this =
=91quest=92=0A=
gives their life meaning =96 everybody wins!=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
I=92ve never had a cause like this that I=92ve been motivated to=0A=
pursue. I am lacking absolutely in any sort of drive. The primary motivator=
=0A=
that has governed my life=2C apart from doing things for enjoyment=92s sake=
=2C is my=0A=
overwhelming terror of pain. When people ask me what my dreams are I am alw=
ays=0A=
at a loss. It seems that I am not striving toward anything but rather runni=
ng=0A=
away from what could cause me pain.=0A=
=0A=
This often gets me in a double bind=2C as usually to avoid=0A=
pain we must experience it. For instance=2C the fear of being short of mone=
y is=0A=
terrifying. But the thought of the stress of work is equally terrifying. An=
d=0A=
so=2C we=92re stuck.=0A=
=0A=
Striving to be free of pain is also interesting as pain is a=0A=
crucial part of being fully alive. Pain is at the root of excitement and fu=
n=2C=0A=
i.e. being at peace (serenity) is not compatible with these! So to purge pa=
in=0A=
is to purge what makes life worth living for most people. Being truly free =
of=0A=
pain is to be dead.=0A=
=0A=
The quest of this civilisation from one perspective is to=0A=
achieve the =91good life=92=2C in which death and pain have no place. It is=
 just like=0A=
how being overly clean harms the immune simple and makes harmless germs=0A=
potentially cause havoc. The more we are sheltered from pain=2C the more th=
e=0A=
tiniest bit of pain can fundamentally shake our worlds.=0A=
=0A=
I feel this is how we have ethics in a godless universe:=0A=
everything hinges on pain. The more we try to avoid something=2C the greate=
r an=0A=
issue it becomes.=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
All this sort of thing=2C I=92ve only become acutely aware of=0A=
recently =96 how my life is one big exercise to avoid pain=2C and yet my wo=
rries=0A=
only get stronger.=0A=
=0A=
I see now why every holidays I lock myself away to do some=0A=
solitary activity=2C be it piano=2C reading or learning. My parents and=0A=
grandparents would much prefer me being out working and getting a bit of=0A=
financial security under my belt. But the thought of dealing with the stres=
s of=0A=
work and other people proves too much for me! This is why I=92m clinging so=
=0A=
desperately to Youth Allowance. This frustrates me=2C as I=92d dearly like=
=0A=
financial security and my parent=92s approval. Safeguarding myself from pai=
n only=0A=
creates more pain in the long run.=0A=
=0A=
To compound the problem=2C a lot of my solitary pursuits are=0A=
not practical in the =91real world=92. So I can=92t even justify them as pr=
eparation=0A=
for anything =96 they=92re just done in my escape world. I could justify th=
em as=0A=
=91leisure=92=2C but leisure is supposed to be done after work=2C not becau=
se we=92re too=0A=
afraid to even begin!=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
I have sometimes wondered where my temperament has come=0A=
from. Why am I so docile and gentle? It is easy to see how people can easil=
y=0A=
become rough. One person is rough=2C then everyone around them has to be ro=
ugh as=0A=
a defence mechanism to face the roughness=2C and so it spreads. Surely=2C b=
eing=0A=
docile and sedate serves no purpose in this society where you have to striv=
e to=0A=
get ahead. Or maybe the gentleness is a sort of defence mechanism. The best=
 way=0A=
to avoid conflict is not to pose a threat. This may explain why my school y=
ears=0A=
were relatively trouble-free: I was too harmless to pose any sort of threat=
!=0A=
The whys and wherefores are unimportant: try as I may=2C I cannot be any ot=
her=0A=
way. Or maybe my acting skills just need work =96 I=92d love to see if I ha=
ve it in=0A=
me to be loud and outgoing as an experiment!=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
A lot of people seem to have mastered this to a tee. That is=0A=
what we must be to get by in the modern world. In order to gain employment=
=2C we=0A=
must be driven=2C enthusiastic=2C passionate and so forth. We must be certa=
in=2C=0A=
confident=2C goal-orientated=2C lively=2C dynamic. All these expectations m=
ake for=0A=
overpowering people=2C as this society is a scramble to the top to gain the=
 boons=0A=
of wealth and approval.=0A=
=0A=
I find a lot of people too overpowering. But then again=2C=0A=
when people are too like me=2C this is also frustrating as I see my own fau=
lts=0A=
staring me in the face! This is one reason I find people=92s problems tryin=
g=2C=0A=
because often their weakness is my weakness. I guess this is why when I=92m=
 happy=0A=
people=92s problems don=92t bother me in the slightest=2C but when I=92m no=
t it=92s=0A=
annoying because I have my own things to deal with!=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
Thanks for enduing stage #57=2C 352 of my existential crisis.=0A=
It is unsettling to realise that my attempts to avoid pain usually have the=
=0A=
effect of making it stronger. I guess I=92m too used to my comfort! It is n=
ot=0A=
easy being sensitive =96 you have the weight of big questions on your shoul=
ders=0A=
and find that the world you must interact with is not conducive to your kin=
d or=0A=
outlook. But as Alan Watts used to say=2C you can only truly experience lif=
e with=0A=
sensitivity. Our sense organs are all so delicate. When they are hardened t=
hey=0A=
are rendered unable to feel =96 to really experience the miracle of existen=
ce and=0A=
all its attendant existential dramas (for better or worse)!=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
Looking forward to hearing back from you as always=2C=0A=
