Hi Albert,

I got in contact with the agent yesterday and have calculated the final
rent, yours is $1021.88. This figure is your remaining rent PLUS 9 days
compensation for mine and Oliver's rent based on the email dated 29/6 when
we could have first given notice. Obviously this is a large amount and
sadly I haven't been able to give you any more notice than this (it's due
Monday 13th) if you have any trouble to pay it on time, let me know so we
can figure something out.

Feel free to talk to me about it,

Sophie
