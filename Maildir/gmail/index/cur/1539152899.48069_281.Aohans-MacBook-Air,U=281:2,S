Hey students,

Attached bellow is the quiz I mentioned at the end of this week's Chinese
class. Take it easy, nobody will be marking you and judge you based on your
result. Phew. I just came up with this idea as I constantly find meself
improving a lot while studying for a test. The answers will be given on
next week's class and also be sent to James to be posted on our website.

Hope you all enjoy it. Have a good one.

Best regards,
Albert
