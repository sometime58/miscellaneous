   Dear Aohan,
   Thank you for your email.
   Your cancellation request has been received.
   Cancellation of your service will be processed on 09/08/2016. As TPG’s Terms
   and Conditions requires 30 days notice for cancellation, your TPG account
   has been charged $38.70 for the 30 days notice period.
   Once we commence processing the request on the cancellation date, it can no
   longer be withdrawn and you will no longer have access to your current
   service. The ADSL service will be removed from your phone line 3-5 working
   days after the cancellation date.
   If you intend to port or transfer your existing TPG telephone number to a
   new provider, please coordinate with your new service provider to discuss
   their telephone number transfer conditions.
   Please note that service providers usually require that you keep your TPG
   telephone number active in order to successfully port it to them.
   Please  advise  if  there  is  anything else that we can be of further
   assistance.
   Kind Regards,

   This has been so much work and Marlon has already left Australia yet it's
   still not done. I just wanna end the service. I'll find other companies. I
   simply can't spend more time on this than I already have. Sorry. Just end
   the service.
