Dear Abby, Albert, Nora and Shirley,

I have just had a friend with a degree in law from the PRC volunteer to
teach the Advanced class which allows Abby to teach the Post-Beginner class.

I think it would be best if Abby and Shirley could teach the Post-Beginner
class together and Albert and Nora can teach the Beginner class.

Shirley taught previously. She is currently overseas but will return in
time for the second class.

Albert and Nora, if you have thought of any topics for the Post-Beginner
class, please send them to Abby and Shirley.

Abby, you may need to decide on topics by yourself because Shirley may be
difficult to contact while she is overseas.

Everyone, please send me a list of topics for your classes as soon as
possible.

If you have any questions about this change or anything else, please let me
know.

Best regards,

Adam Spottiswood
