Dear Albert,


This Saturday, the founder of SAIL, Matthew Albert will be presenting a talk on the history and philosophy of SAIL. Matthew founded SAIL in 2001 along with Anna-Grace but stepped away to pursue his very successful career as a barrister. This presentation will take place in the Sunshine SAIL's auditorium at 80B Harvester Rd, Sunshine from 12:45 - 1:30pm (it's not compulsory that you attend, just for your own interest). 

On another note, unfortunately we received a complaint from our neighbours of the community centre about students using the emergency exit gate from the back garden of the centre. Please keep an eye out for this and remind students about the boundaries of the community centre. Thank you very much for your help with this. 

We are looking forward to another wonderful Saturday! See you then. 

Smooth SAILing,
Nyssa Watson, Carlo Manley, Malang Deng, Yoshi Inada-Lane and Alex Heath
Coordinators (Footscray campus)
