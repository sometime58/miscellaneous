Hi Albert,

The breakdown for the bills is as follows:

Internet for June and July
$54

Gas
$30.37

Electricity
$126

Total
$210.37

Bills are attached to pinboard for your reference

Also we have been having a weevil (bugs which later become moths)
infestation in the pantry so tomorrow I think I will move all the food out
and fumigate the cupboards. I try to keep all my grains and flours in
sealed plastic containers to prevent them from getting into the food but
there must be so many that they are finding a way in and I am still
sometimes finding little maggot worms in my food!

We may have to repeat this process again in a few weeks, but in the mean
time if you can try to keep food sealed and preferably in hard plastic
containers then hopefully we will eliminate them!
