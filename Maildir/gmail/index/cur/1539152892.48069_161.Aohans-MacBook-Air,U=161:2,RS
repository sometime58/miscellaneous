Dear Albert,

It is that time of the year where we share a slice of cake (or two) and celebrate SAIL’s birthday! As you may be aware, the SAIL Birthday is one of the only days in the SAIL calendar where we get to meet, celebrate and share our Saturday morning with SAILors from all across Melbourne’s 5 campuses. 

So, as you can imagine, there is a lot of food involved! And in order to ensure everyone is well fed on the day we need your help. 

Would you be happy to offer your assistance as a food volunteer on the day? Please disregard this request if you are able to help drive SAILors on the day. Below is the information on how the food will be prepared.

1. Making the food:

The day will begin for the food volunteers at 9.30am at the Maidstone campus (located at 21 Yardley st Maidstone). Here we will prepare the usual SAIL lunches (sandwiches only – no hot food) and cut up the fruit.

If all volunteers could please bring their own:

-	Chopping board
-	Knife
-	Tea-towel 

From there we will load up people’s cars and transport the food to the Birthday venue (located at 45 Moreland st Footscray) by approximately 10.30am. 

Hopefully we won’t have to prepare anything on site (as the kitchen is a little on the tiny side) but other volunteers will bring food so we will have to be prepared to organise these things on arrival.

Which is where the second part of your help is required.

2.  Handing out the food:

Throughout the celebrations we will need volunteers help to carry around boxes/trays/platters of food to ensure that everyone was well fed. Last year we found it worked best to stagger out bringing the food, simply to ensure that at least some healthy sandwiches were being eaten &#9786;. Then around midday we will start to send out the sweets that are always in abundance thanks to our generous volunteers.

We will also be having a barbeque running so everyone should have plenty of food to eat!

Your help would be very much appreciated on the day, either for all or part of it. Please let me know ASAP via events@sailprogram.org.au or on 0413 841 743 if you think you will be able to help.

Many thanks and smooth SAILing,

Freya Carbone 
Food coordinator for the birthday

 Nyssa, Alex, Malang and Yoshi
