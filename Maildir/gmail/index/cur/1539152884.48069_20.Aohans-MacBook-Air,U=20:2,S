Hi Albert=2C
Hope that you're feeling a bit better today!
I don't have too much to say - it's amazing how mundane my life is without =
stirring about angsty abstractions!
Thankfully a cool change blew through today so it was under 40 degrees toda=
y for once! How amazing the world is - such extremes in temperature. Speaki=
ng of the world=2C I've started reading a book called 'A Short History of N=
early Everything' which is basically a general overview of scientific conce=
pts for dummies. It starts off talking about the universe. It is truly spir=
itual considering how our universe came into being (maybe one of millions o=
f universes?) and its sheer magnitude. It's wonderful how insignificant I f=
eel haha. And all the variables that had to be just right to create all the=
 heavy elements besides H and He=2C let alone ones favourable for life.The =
unfortunate thing about reading is that I come across so many wonderful fac=
ts except forget them pretty much straight away. Maybe I'll have to keep a =
record just so I have something non-weather related to talk about haha.
It's well and truly Christmas time with it being nearly impossible to move =
in the local shopping centre! I'm really lucky that no one expects me to bu=
y them presents. I wonder how long I can keep that up for. I don't want to =
be one of those frantic shoppers!
Everything's very boring and trivial otherwise. But I seem to have quite a =
tolerance for boredom thank goodness!
I'll have to go do something crazy just so I have something to write about =
haha.
Hope you feel better soon!
