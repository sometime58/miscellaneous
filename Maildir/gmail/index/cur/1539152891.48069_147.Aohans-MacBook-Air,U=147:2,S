Dear Albert,

As you may already be aware, the SAIL Birthday is now exactly one month away, being held on Saturday October 4th at the Footscray Community Arts Centre. The preparations for this exciting, fun-filled event are well and truly underway and we're asking volunteers whether they can help out.

We will be having a BBQ on the day and are looking for volunteers to bring their BBQ and utensils, SAIL will provide meat, onions, oil etc… The person who brought theirs last year is unable to access it again, so we're now trying to organise a backup.
The role would include driving the BBQ to the venue, setting up at around 10.30, cooking at the BBQ til about 12 and then packing up. We can organize some other volunteers to help with the cooking aswell.

There is also one other job that we're trying to fill. If you have any spare time on Friday 3rd of October, we have a couple of marquees and bins which are in storage in Seddon, that need to be taken to the Birthday.

Thank you for being such awesome SAILors!

Look forward to seeing all of you on Saturday.

Smooth SAILing,
Nyssa Watson, Malang Deng, Alex Heath & Yoshi Inada-Lane
