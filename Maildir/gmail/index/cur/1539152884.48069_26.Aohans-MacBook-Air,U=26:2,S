Hello Alberto the Kind=2C
=20
I feel we share the similar sensation when talking with others - I often fe=
el like a mirror and usually just go along with what the other person is sa=
ying. Hence people usually say 'we're so similar' when actually we're anyth=
ing but.=20
For my part=2C I feel like a good listener just coz I don't have too much e=
xciting stuff to say for myself coz I live such an uneventful cushy life ha=
ha. It can get a little trying in large doses though of course!
Going along with everyone and what they want is an easy way to make people =
like you=2C but as soon as you voice your own preferences or disagree then =
watch out haha.
=20
Advice is a tricky subject coz good practical advice can really help. The o=
nly problem is that when I'm in a tough spot=2C I usually don't follow my o=
wn advice!
=20
That boy is interesting. A lot of people have preferences as to who they wa=
nt to talk to. Snobs only want to talk to snobs=2C bogans only want to talk=
 to bogans and so forth. It may be for the best that he has his preferences=
 and just pretends to be polite to people he doesn't want to talk to. In an=
 ideal world people should talk to everyone=2C but in real life it's hard t=
o avoid preferences. Acting is therefore necessary!
=20
I haven't been back to play piano - it's far easier just to stay at home an=
d read haha. I'd like to tomorrow or the next day. One of my uncles is movi=
ng house tomorrow except my other uncle wants to go on a daytrip instead as=
 he has only a week or so here after coming from England. He has really poi=
nted out to me that I just agree with everything anyone says and go along w=
ith any suggestions. He says I need to learn to say no haha.
I know most people feel like this=2C but inside myself there's a nice lamb =
and a bold hungry wolf - a kind of yin yang. Most times the wolf sleeps but=
 when it wakes it cannot help go after the lamb and I feel like such a path=
etic loser pushover. It is so easy to be content if you give up striving an=
d trying. If you actually start trying to get your life happening=2C it's u=
sually a recipe for frustration=2C inadequacy and dissatisfaction haha.=20
=20
I think I need to become a bit more canny about my looks. I usually just go=
 to the hairdresser with no idea what I want except for 'shorter'. I've als=
o been wearing the same clothes for at least five years haha.
No beer for Chrissy and New Year thank goodness! The beach is very nice. A =
lot of the time in the surf is spent dodging body board riders!
It's funny in that the more you try to take care of your body the more you =
notice that things are wrong! It's really annoying like that haha.
=20
My uncle had one of his school friend stay over a few nights. I think he is=
 a multi million dollar businessman and he took the whole family out for me=
als which was amazing. It's funny how so many people stress about money and=
 then to others it is no concern at all. If only! I think not having kids i=
s a bit of a head start haha.
=20
Hope you feel fully recovered soon!

Hello=0A=
my little Lachy=2C=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
Sorry=0A=
for not having replied you for the last few days. It=92s just there were so=
 many=0A=
dramas going on recently that=92s causing me no time at hand to say anythin=
g=0A=
decent and without a stable emotion to talk about anything=2C if that makes=
 sense=0A=
to you. It seems that all the people I=92ve been meeting the past three day=
s have=0A=
so many dramas to share with others. And unfortunately I was the guy they=
=92d=0A=
share with. Every time when I found no things to talk I=92ll just nod my he=
ad and=0A=
it felt so awkward. But I always think of myself as a good listener. Someti=
mes I=0A=
think what people need is just somebody being there for them to talk to. Th=
ey need=0A=
to pour out their storied and just by telling them they can feel better lik=
e=0A=
some kind of release. So when I=92m being with them=2C I try to ask questio=
ns like=0A=
why and how those things happened. This is like glue that holds their littl=
e=0A=
pieces of mind together and helps them continue the story telling. I guess =
that=92s=0A=
why they always want to talk to me=2C even sometimes online for hours=2C wh=
ich=2C by=0A=
the way=2C is so annoying I feel. =0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
It=0A=
seems being a good friend is such a tough task. You have to train yourself =
not=0A=
to be so emotionally attached to every drama they tell=2C otherwise it=92ll=
 become=0A=
too much to carry and finally get to you and make you feel emotionally drai=
ned.=0A=
I find talking to people makes you learn. It says people learn from mistake=
s. But=0A=
it doesn=92t have to be mistakes made by your own right (lol). After long=
=0A=
conversations=2C you begin to know how others think different and you=92ll =
know=0A=
next time what they really need to get from your conversations and you just=
 say=0A=
what=92s needed to be said. Talking to people=2C as you may understand=2C p=
ersonally=0A=
speaking is a mystery. You feel that what they want to get from you is noth=
ing=0A=
but meaningless comforting words and flattering praises. It doesn=92t even =
have=0A=
to be sincere=2C just nice to the ear and you=92ll be fine. I don=92t like =
it=2C as it=0A=
doesn=92t really help with the situation they are dealing with. But what do=
 I know.=0A=
Maybe just being supporting is helpful enough most of time. =0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
About=0A=
the boy I mentioned last time=2C there are quite some things happened after=
 I talked=0A=
but I=92d better not tell you much. I think he=92ll make a good case study =
for an=0A=
education subject. He=92s so typical and there are things a researcher can =
study=0A=
from. The story of a spoiled child is never an over dated material. Also th=
is=0A=
experience shows me how stereotype talking of gay people having to be over =
sensitive=0A=
about their look while straight ones don't just doesn=92t work so well. He=
=92s such=0A=
a self-conscious adolescent that he wouldn't=92 even want to talk to people=
 he=0A=
doesn=92t think look nice. That=92s so insane! I=92ve seen people who judge=
 others=0A=
just by the way they look and dress but after all if you ask they=92d say i=
t=92s=0A=
wrong doing that. But he just seems no shame to admit it. not I=92m an expe=
rt in=0A=
psychology=2C but  by the way he talks=0A=
about how uncomfortable he feels just talking to =91ugly looking=92 people =
that he=0A=
almost feels fainted just doesn=92t make any sense at all and I=2C if were =
asked=2C=0A=
would say there is problem about his mental state. =0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
But=0A=
just to think=2C if you look at it from a different angle=2C he=92s still t=
alking to=0A=
me. So I guess I don=92t look so bad looking right haha. It=92s nice you ha=
ve=0A=
chance to practice on piano during your trip. Don=92t say anything like you=
 are a=0A=
loser. You are nice and talented and gentle and kind. I can even imagine ho=
w=0A=
wonderfully I would feel if I were there when you are playing them your pie=
ces.=0A=
It=92s so joyful seeing you all concentrated and submerged into the world o=
f=0A=
music. You are like an angel. Angel of Music you are! J=0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
Speaking=0A=
of angel=2C how=92s your new haircut look (lol). Did you get tired of the o=
ld style=0A=
and feel like changing into another one? I feel changing hairstyle can make=
 you=0A=
feel as if you=92ve even changed your emotion and attitude. It makes you=0A=
refreshed in some way or another. So hope you feel even happier than you=0A=
already are. And also I forgot to ask=2C how=92s your summer Christmas and =
New=0A=
Year? Does being seaside really feel any different from having a freezing c=
old=0A=
new year. I bet you had some beer then of course. The sea=2C the alcohol=2C=
 and the=0A=
golden sand beach=2C with family. Must been a great time. =0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
I=0A=
think I=92m spoiled by the good weather in Melbourne. My cold has been on a=
nd off=0A=
for quite a while lately. Today I got up with my throat too painful to spea=
k=0A=
anything. I=92ve never considered myself to be man with few words but right=
 now I=0A=
am haha. And damn it doesn=92t feel any good at all. It=92s strange i=92ve =
never been=0A=
feeling so much worried about if you have taken care of yourself good ever=
=0A=
before than I am right now. perhaps it=92s just my sick man mood. But do ta=
ke=0A=
good care. I had some bacon and mushrooms for lunch today. It was good. Ver=
y giving=0A=
you enjoyment of taste and power of your body. =0A=
=0A=
 =0A=
=0A=
That=0A=
concludes my letter now. I think I=92ll have to watch some gay themed comed=
y to=0A=
cheer me up later. Lol=0A=
