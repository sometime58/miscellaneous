Hello 

I wanted to check in with you as planned as you have previously expressed your interest in securing a position later in 2017 and I said that we should start to talk about your preferences and the timeline to securing you a position now. 

They say the early bird always catches the worm, and this is our approach so our teachers secure the best positions when vacancies start to come through in the new year at our top schools employing for April or September. 

We have limited spaces available for our iday events in March, April and May of next year, and if you want to come along on an all expenses paid week in London or our regional events to interview with multiple schools and secure a role that is the perfect fit for next September we definitely need to start the process soon. 

Our iday week-long events are also the perfect opportunity to meet lots of other teachers from all over the world who you will soon call friends, experience London and gain some excellent CPD with our partners at Creative Education. They will support you throughout your time in England with individual and bespoke support free of charge. 

We offer day to day, contract, permanent and secure guaranteed supply work. We can also offer PAYE or Umbrella pay options and our schools are not limited in type. We also have schools in all parts of England and we will not be pushing you towards one way of working in England. One size never fits all. 

As the winner of the UK Investor in Education 'Top Educational Recruitment Service' for the last 4 out of the last 5 years I am confident we can work with you to find a fantastic role. We love what we do and our proud of what we have achieved for our teachers. 

I just need to start the conversation with you soon. 
When are you free to have a quick chat to get the ball rolling? 

I will be here as your best resource from the moment you get started and I look forward to working with you. It is a free service and I am a teacher who has lived and worked in the UK. 


Kind Regards 

Katherine
