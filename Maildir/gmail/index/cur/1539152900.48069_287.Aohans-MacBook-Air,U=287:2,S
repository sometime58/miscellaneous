Dear Albert,

Unfortunately Kylie and Gilberto are not staying at SAIL meaning that we do not have anybody to prepare lunch this Saturday. 

I am writing to see if any volunteers would be interested in going to the Sunshine campus in order to prepare lunch this Saturday (2nd May). Lunch is an important component of our Saturday sessions and it would be greatly appreciated if you were interested in making sandwiches for Maidstone. 

We also have a considerable number of drivers that are unable to come this Saturday, meaning that we have no means of getting some students to Maidstone unless their families are able to organise something for them. If you are able to pick up students as well, that would be fantastic, it would simply be a temporary measure for this week. 

If you are interested in either assisting in the kitchen or picking up students please let me know by replying to this email.


Thank you

Smooth SAILing,
Nyssa Watson, Carlo Manley, Malang Deng, Yoshi Inada-Lane and Alex Heath
