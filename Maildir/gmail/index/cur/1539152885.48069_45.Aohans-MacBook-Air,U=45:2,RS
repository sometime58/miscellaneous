Hey Albert,

I received the transfer for the bills so thanks for that. There was another
one that came in after I sent that email for the gas, but it's only $13.80
so no hurry on that one. There is a new housemate in Andreas room, just so
you don't get a fright when you get back. His name is Tom and he studies
landscape architecture at Melbourne uni. He's very nice. He has put a TV in
the living room which is cool, but I haven't watched anything on it yet.
Anyway, you must be returning pretty soon because it's O-week this week.
Look forward to seeing you again,

Sophie
