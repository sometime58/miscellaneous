Dear Albert,

We will be back at the Maidstone Community Centre this Saturday, the 18th of April, and oh my are we excited!

We will also be having an Xtend session with Engineers without Borders (Ingénieurs Sans Frontières) organised by our fantastic volunteer Priyani from 12:30pm. Any volunteers who would like to join us and assist supering students would be great, please let either Priyani or Nyssa, Carlo or Alex know. 

We appreciate your patience over the last 2 weeks and hope you're excited to start up again!


Smooth SAILing,
Carlo Manley, Nyssa Watson, Alex Heath
