Hi Albert,

First good news:

1. We are now all successfully on the lease and do not have to pay the $150
fee.

2. The landlord has changed real estate agents, so we now pay the rent
through True Property, *NOT RENDINA *
When it comes to pay the rent this month, it's very important that we
switch the BPay to the correct biller code as follows:
Biller code: 4481
Reference Number: 0023995152
The rent amount remains exactly the same, however, we have to pay by the
12th, not 13th (I think we were supposed to pay by 12th with Rendina just
that they never said anything about it)

Let me know if you need any help with it.

Now, bad news, bills!

Internet (Apr/May) - $27.40
Gas - $30.20

*Total $57.60*

Internet for May/Jun should arrive soon.

Thanks for letting Raya stay, she's gone now just so you know.

Sophie
