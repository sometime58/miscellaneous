Hi Aohan,

I'm horrible with tones. I never really focused on it when I started
because it wasn't worth a lot of marks in International Baccalaureate. I
think it is easy enough to differentiate once you hear enough examples, it
just needs to be somewhat overemphasized at first.

Thanks for all your hard work. Your PPT looks very creative as always.
Second last class today!

Cheers,

Adam
