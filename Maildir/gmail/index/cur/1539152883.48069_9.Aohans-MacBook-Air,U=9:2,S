Albert,

I trust this e-mail, being from whom you would expect given the sender's
address, finds you well. Have you arrived in Beijing yet?

In any case, for reference purposes you will find at the link below some
blog posts by the author of the book on Aquinas I lent you arranged by
topic, and which you may peruse at your leisure.

If you have any trouble accessing the link, I can send you a pdf
compilation of the posts which I have made for my personal use.

"*Potentia et actus ita dividunt ens, ut quidquid est, vel sit actus purus,
vel ex potentia et actu tamquam primis atque intrinsecis principiis
necessario coalescat.*"
"Potency and Act divide being in such a way that whatever is, is either
pure act, or of necessity it is composed of potency and act as primary and
intrinsic principles."
- 1st Thomistic Thesis
