Hi Albert=2C
I think that's good thinking. I'm feeling quite deflated and would not make=
 very nice company.
Some days I feel on top of things=2C others I feel crushed.
I'll see you later :)

I just thought it might be better you have some time alone after a stressfu=
l day and I don't want to interrupt your rest and go bother you even more. =
So I'll let you take a nap and relax. :-)
