Dear Sir,

I am a 3rd year psychology undergraduate student at Melbourne Uni. I want
to ask about the entry requisition for the honour's year. Could you please
tell me what results and scores will be looked at for a fourth year
psychology degree application. And, just in case that I fail to reach the
hurdle, what should I do if I still want to pursue the study in psychology
honour's at Melbourne Uni.

Thank you.
Kind regards,
Aohan
