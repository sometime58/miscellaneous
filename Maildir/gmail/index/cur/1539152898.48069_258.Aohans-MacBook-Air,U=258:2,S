Hey there, RealLifer!

This is Justin, back for another rockin’ RealLife newsletter. This week we have some fantastic material on learning English with TV series, as well as some exciting news, AND brand new episode of RealLife Radio!

We all know how more easily we learn when we're actually having FUN! That’s why English speaking TV series are one of the best ways to learn.

With this in mind, we’ve got a brand new article on Why You Should Learn English with TV [ http://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=Ad2lA&m=3b.sGVRych5r18H&b=RhC4XCCBJKLv_wozAR_4VA ], exploring how using TV as a learning tool dramatically improves your motivation, your habits, and accelerates your fluency. IN FACT, this is one the best tools that exists!

We’re so confident in this, we’ve decided to create a revolutionary new learning material that makes it possible to use the TV series Friends as the core component of your English learning. We’re working real hard right now getting it ready, but you’ll hear more about this in a few weeks!! Aww yeah!!!

Ethan also shared a classic RLE article, "10 TV Shows Which You’ll Love Learning English With [ http://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=Ad2lA&m=3b.sGVRych5r18H&b=kmNUGe1Y2uEE7ynoaJC_xA ]," and Chad a classic video lesson Called “A Mistake Most English Learners Don’t Know They’re Making,” which explains why saying “a 5-star” hotel (not “5-starS) is correct.


And finally, for RealLife Radio #99 [ http://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=Ad2lA&m=3b.sGVRych5r18H&b=.9vl5N3hPO9lHJD5Gb7g_A ], we released another Australia episode, the first time we’ve ever had another Australian on the show (in addition to Chad). We talk about Australian culture, slang, and humor. Think your English is good? Try Australian English!  [ http://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=Ad2lA&m=3b.sGVRych5r18H&b=.9vl5N3hPO9lHJD5Gb7g_A ]Next week we've got a really big and
awesome episode 100!!!

I’ve enjoyed sharing with y’all today! Keep kicking ass with your English and as ever, let us know if you have any questions or suggestions. We read every e-mail. Justin hit REPLY!

Awww yeah!

Have a great rest of the week.

Chad, Justin, and Ethan
