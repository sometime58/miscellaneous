Hi Alberto=2C
Uni's still the same. After I hand in this week's essay=2C I've got a 2500 =
word one due the week after! I take so long to do them! It's really frustra=
ting as it chews up all my 'free' time.
For my group assignment=2C which we present on 1 April=2C we're doing 'cult=
urally and linguistically diverse' students. I'm just wondering if you have=
 any advice as to what teachers could do to help these students (whose firs=
t language isn't English) in Australian high schools? We also need to put o=
urselves in the shoes of a 'culturally and linguistically diverse' student =
- how does it feel?
Feel free to answer those questions if it suits :)
I may be too busy to catch up on Tuesday night - if only I could just make =
things up for the essay haha.But I'll let you know if that changes. I'll de=
finitely see you Friday!
Talk soon :)
