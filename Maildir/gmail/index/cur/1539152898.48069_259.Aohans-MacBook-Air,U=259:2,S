Hi SAIL Maidstone Volunteers,

Unfortunately, the Braybrook Community Hub have let us know that they are
unable to accommodate us this Saturday, due to a delay in the delivery of
furniture for the centre.

Sadly, *SAIL is cancelled for this Saturday, April the 11th. *However, the
SAIL Sunshine campus will host a small group of Maidstone VCE students and
their tutors.

As we understand, the *Maidstone Community Centre* will be available for
our group to return as usual on *Saturday the 18th April. *We will send you
an email to confirm this next week.

Carlo and I will contact SAIL families tomorrow to let them know about the
cancellation again this week. We will also be inviting all VCE students to
attend the Sunshine campus this Saturday to assist with any upcoming
assessments and tests.

We sincerely apologise for this inconvenience, and appreciate any concerns
you may have due to SAIL being cancelled two weeks running.

We are excited to run as usual from next Saturday.

Additionally, Malang and Yoshi are stepping down from their roles as SAIL
coordinators, Malang after 4 years and Yoshi after 2. We would like to
thank them very much for the wonderful work they have done for SAIL. We
will be organising a get together on a Sunday (in the very near future) to
thank them. It will also be a nice chance for tutors to get to know each
other. If you happen to have any exciting ideas for this get together
please let Carlo or myself know.

Thank you for your patience and understanding, we look forward to seeing
you next Saturday.

Have a nice weekend!

Smooth SAILing,
Nyssa Watson, Malang Deng, Carlo Manley, Yoshi Inada-Lane & Alex Heath
Coordinators (Footscray campus)
